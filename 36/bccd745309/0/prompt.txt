Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Show Total Skills & Standards in Packmind Promotion Section

## Context

The Packmind promotion section on the Remediate tab currently shows static promotional text. The user wants it to display the **total count of skills and standards created across all remediations** for the current repo, making the section data-driven and more compelling.

## Changes

### 1. Extract `countPackmindArtifacts` and `formatArtifactCount` to shared utility

**File**: `frontend/src/components/RemediationHistoryCard.tsx` → new shared location

These two functions are currently defined in `RemediationHistoryCard.tsx` (lines 42-61). They need to be reusable from `RemediateTab.tsx` as well.

- Move `countPackmindArtifacts()` and `formatArtifactCount()` to a new shared file `frontend/src/utils/packmind-artifacts.ts`
- Update imports in `RemediationHistoryCard.tsx`

### 2. Compute aggregated totals in `RemediateTab.tsx`

**File**: `frontend/src/components/RemediateTab.tsx`

The `remediations` state (array of `RemediationHistoryItem`) is already available. Each item has `result.summary.errorFixActions` and `result.summary.suggestionEnrichActions` with `outputType` fields.

- Add a `useMemo` that iterates all remediations, collects all actions, and sums up standards/skills using `countPackmindArtifacts()`
- Pass totals to the Packmind section

### 3. Update Packmind promotion section UI

**File**: `frontend/src/components/RemediateTab.tsx` (lines 535-570)

- When totals > 0: Show "Your remediations have created X standard(s) & Y skill(s) so far." before the existing description
- When totals = 0: Keep current static text as-is (no artifact counts to show)

## Files to Modify

1. `frontend/src/utils/packmind-artifacts.ts` (new - shared utility)
2. `frontend/src/components/RemediationHistoryCard.tsx` (update imports)
3. `frontend/src/components/RemediateTab.tsx` (add aggregation + update UI)

## Verification

1. `bun run test` - all tests pass
2. `bun run lint` - no lint errors
3. Manual: Run `bun run dev`, navigate to Remediate tab on a repo with past remediations, verify totals show in the Packmind section
4. Manual: Verify a repo with no remediations shows the static text without counts
