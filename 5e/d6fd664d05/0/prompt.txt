Implement the following plan:

# Fix: Frontend flooding backend with remediation API requests

## Context

The frontend sends dozens of identical `GET /api/remediation/for-evaluation/{id}` requests per second (~50+ within a single second). This happens because `useEvaluationApi()` returns a **new object on every render**, and `RemediateTab.tsx` uses that object in a `useEffect` dependency array — causing the effect (which fetches remediation status) to re-run on every render in an infinite loop.

## Root Cause

1. **`useEvaluationApi()`** (`frontend/src/hooks/useEvaluationApi.ts:467-481`) returns a plain object literal. While each callback inside is individually stable (`useCallback(fn, [])`), the wrapping object is recreated every render.

2. **`RemediateTab.tsx:162`** has `[evaluationId, api]` as useEffect deps. Since `api` is a new reference every render, the effect re-runs continuously, each time calling `getRemediationForEvaluation()`.

3. **`useProviderDetection()`** (`frontend/src/hooks/useProviderDetection.ts:97-104`) has the same unstable-object pattern. Less impactful (guarded by `if status === "idle"`) but still causes unnecessary effect re-runs.

## Changes

### 1. `frontend/src/hooks/useEvaluationApi.ts`
- Add `useMemo` to imports
- Wrap the return object (lines 467-481) in `useMemo` with all its properties as dependencies
- Since all callbacks have `[]` deps (stable), the memo only breaks when `isLoading` or `error` actually change

### 2. `frontend/src/hooks/useProviderDetection.ts`
- Add `useMemo` to imports
- Wrap the return object (lines 97-104) in `useMemo` with all its properties as dependencies
- Object stays stable once provider detection completes

## What this does NOT change
- No component files modified — fix is entirely in the hooks
- No dependency arrays removed — they are correct per exhaustive-deps; the bug was in the hooks
- No polling/debouncing added — the intent is a one-time fetch on mount, and after this fix that's what happens

## Collateral benefits
- `BatchStatusPage.tsx` has an existing `useRef` workaround for this same bug — becomes unnecessary (harmless to leave)
- `App.tsx` callbacks (`handleSubmit`, `handleBatchSubmit`, `handleCancelJob`) stop being needlessly recreated
- `PatchDownload.tsx` `handleDownload` stops being recreated every render

## Verification
1. `bun run test` — no regressions
2. `bun run lint` + `bun run typecheck` — clean
3. Manual: open RemediateTab with Network tab → confirm `/api/remediation/for-evaluation/{id}` is called once on mount, not continuously
