Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Clear issue selection basket after remediation

## Context

After a remediation completes, the top bar still shows "X issues selected" with Clear/Remediate buttons (the `SelectionSummaryBar`). This is confusing because the remediation has already been executed for those issues. The selection basket should be automatically emptied when a remediation runs successfully.

## Current behavior

1. User selects issues → `selectedIssueKeys` state + DB persistence via `selectionApi`
2. User clicks Remediate → `RemediateTab` executes remediation
3. Remediation completes → `phase` changes to `"results"`, but selections remain untouched
4. The `SelectionSummaryBar` still renders because `selectedIssueKeys.size > 0`

## Fix

**File: `frontend/src/components/RemediateTab.tsx`**

Add a `useEffect` that calls `onClearAll()` when the component transitions to the `"results"` phase. This covers both:
- Fresh remediation completion (via SSE `remediation.completed` event)
- Restored completed remediation (via `loadExistingRemediation` on mount)

```tsx
// After existing useEffect blocks (~line 167)
useEffect(() => {
  if (phase === "results") {
    onClearAll();
  }
}, [phase, onClearAll]);
```

This is the minimal change needed. `onClearAll` is `handleClearSelection` from App.tsx which:
- Clears frontend state: `setSelectedIssueKeys(new Set())`
- Clears DB: `selectionApi.clearSelections(currentEvaluationId)`

Once selections are cleared, `SelectionSummaryBar` returns `null` (line 14 check: `selectedCount === 0`), hiding the bar.

## Verification

1. Run `bun run test`
2. Run `bun run lint`
3. Manual test: select issues → run remediation → verify the top bar disappears when remediation completes
4. Manual test: reload page with a completed remediation → verify the bar doesn't flash then disappear
