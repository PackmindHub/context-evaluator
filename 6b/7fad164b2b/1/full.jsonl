It should complement README.md by containing detailed, agent-specific guidance about build steps, tests, conventions, and project-specific workflows.\n\n**Evaluation Constraints**: You will ONLY receive the AGENTS.md file content itself, without access to the actual codebase, README.md, or other files. Focus on intrinsic quality signals detectable from the text alone.\n\n---\n\n## Your Focus Area: Completeness & Depth Issues\n\nYou are detecting issues where the file is either too short/skeletal or too verbose/overwhelming.\n\n### 10.1 Extremely Short or Skeletal Content\n\n**Detection Signals:**\n- Only 1-2 sections present\n- Sections have only 1-2 sentences\n- No code blocks or command examples\n- Looks like a template that wasn't filled out\n\n**Example of Bad:**\n```markdown\n# AGENTS.md\n\n## Setup\nInstall dependencies and run the project.\n\n## Testing\nRun tests before committing.\n```\n\n**Why It's Bad:** Insufficient information for agents to work effectively.\n\n**How to Detect:**\n- Count code blocks (0-1 suggests missing commands)\n- Count sections (< 3 suggests incompleteness)\n- Look for template-like placeholder text\n- Check for absence of executable commands\n\n---\n\n### 10.2 Over-Detailed or Excessive Content\n\n**Detection Signals:**\n- Extensive narrative explanations for every small detail\n- Repeated information across sections\n- Tutorial-style content teaching basic concepts\n- Over-documentation of obvious steps\n\n**Example of Bad:**\n```markdown\n## Installing Node.js\nFirst, you need to understand what Node.js is.

You can download it from\nthe official website, or you can use a version manager like nvm...\n[300 lines about all possible installation methods]\n```\n\n**Why It's Bad:** Too much information makes it hard to find relevant instructions; agents get overwhelmed.\n\n**How to Detect:**\n- Look for tutorial-style teaching content\n- Identify repeated concepts or sections\n- Check for basic concept explanations (what is git, what is a compiler)\n- Measure ratio of narrative to actionable content\n\n---\n\n### 10.3 Inappropriate Content Placement\n\nDetect when technology-specific content appears in root AGENTS.md when appropriate subdirectories exist.\n\n**What This Section Detects:**\n\nRoot AGENTS.md should contain **generic, universal guidelines** applicable across the entire repository.\nSubdirectory AGENTS.md files should contain **context-specific rules** for that domain.\n\n**Detection Signals:**\n\n1. **Framework/Technology-Specific Content in Root:**\n   - Frontend frameworks: \"React\", \"Vue\", \"Angular\", \"component\", \"useState\", \"JSX\"\n   - UI libraries: \"Chakra UI\", \"Material-UI\", \"Tailwind\", \"styled-components\"\n   - Backend frameworks: \"Django\", \"Flask\", \"Express\", \"FastAPI\", \"Spring Boot\"\n   - ORMs/Databases: \"Prisma\", \"TypeORM\", \"SQLAlchemy\", \"Hibernate\", \"migration\"\n   - Mobile: \"React Native\", \"Flutter\", \"SwiftUI\", \"Jetpack Compose\"\n\n2. **Subdirectories Exist:**\n   - Check for section headers showing multiple files (e.g., FILE 1, FILE 2, etc.)\n   - Check for directory structure mentions in root (e.g., \"frontend/\", \"backend/\")\n   - Check for cross-references (e.g., \"See frontend/AGENTS.md\")\n\n3. **Subdirectory is Skeletal:**\n   - Subdirectory has <20 lines OR\n   - Subdirectory only references root (\"See root AGENTS.md\") OR\n   - Subdirectory has only generic content when specific content exists in root\n\n**Severity Calculation:**\n\n| Severity | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **9** | 50+ lines of technology-specific content in root when subdirectory exists and is mostly empty |\n| **8** | 30-50 lines of technology-specific content in root when subdirectory exists |\n| **7** | 20-30 lines of technology-specific content in root with subdirectory |\n| **6** | Some technology-specific content in root that would fit better in subdirectory |\n| **≤5** | DO NOT REPORT |\n\n**Output Format:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"category\": \"Completeness & Balance\",\n  \"section\": \"10.3\",\n  \"severity\": 8,\n  \"title\": \"Technology-Specific Content in Root AGENTS.md\",\n  \"description\": \"Root AGENTS.md contains extensive React-specific guidelines that should be moved to frontend/AGENTS.md\",\n  \"problem\": \"Root file contains 45 lines about React components, hooks, and Chakra UI styling\",\n  \"impact\": \"Root file becomes cluttered with framework-specific details instead of universal guidelines.

extract from FILE header\n    \"start\": 10,\n    \"end\": 15\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPay attention to:\n- File boundaries marked by `================================================================================`\n- File path appears in both start and end separators\n- Periodic reminders throughout long files: `--- Still in file: path ---`\n\n### AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md Pair Exemption\n\n**CRITICAL**: When AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md exist in the same directory with identical or similar content, this is INTENTIONAL and should NOT be flagged.\n\nThese files serve as mirrors for different AI agent compatibility:\n- AGENTS.md: Standard for general AI coding agents\n- CLAUDE.md: Standard for Claude Code specifically\n\n**DO NOT flag duplication between colocated AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md pairs.**\n**DO flag inconsistencies** that could cause different agent behaviors.\n\n### Packmind Standards Sections (EXCLUDED FROM COMPARISON)\n\n**CRITICAL**: When comparing AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md files for consistency or missing content, **completely exclude Packmind Standards sections** from the comparison.\n\n**Why:**\n- Packmind tool intentionally deploys standards only to AGENTS.md files\n- CLAUDE.md files will not contain Packmind standards by design\n- This difference is intentional, not a documentation gap\n\n**Detection - Content to Skip:**\n\n1. **HTML Comment Markers:**\n   ```html\n   <!-- start: Packmind standards -->\n   ...content here...\n   <!-- end: Packmind standards -->\n   ```\n\n2. **Section Headings:**\n   - `# Packmind Standards` or `## Packmind Standards`\n   - All content until the next major heading or end of file\n\n**How to Handle:**\n\n- When AGENTS.md contains Packmind Standards sections but CLAUDE.md does not: **DO NOT flag as missing content**\n- When comparing file completeness: **Exclude Packmind content from both files before comparison**\n- Content differences related to Packmind standards are **NEVER an issue**\n\n**Example - DO NOT REPORT:**\n\n```\nFILE 1: apps/frontend/AGENTS.md (140 lines)\n[38 lines of regular content]\n\n<!-- start: Packmind standards -->\n## Testing Standards\n[100 lines of Packmind-generated standards]\n<!-- end: Packmind standards -->\n\nFILE 2: apps/frontend/CLAUDE.md (38 lines)\n[38 lines of regular content - same as AGENTS.md]\n```\n\n**This is CORRECT** - CLAUDE.md has the same manual content as AGENTS.md. The missing Packmind section is intentional.\n\n**DO NOT flag:**\n- \"CLAUDE.md lacks X standards present in AGENTS.md\" when X is Packmind content\n- \"CLAUDE.md is shorter than AGENTS.md\" when the length difference is Packmind content\n- Any inconsistency where the missing content is within Packmind markers or under a Packmind Standards heading\n\n---\n\n### Cross-File Completeness Issues\n\n**CRITICAL**: Length differences alone are NOT problems. Focus on content appropriateness.\n\n#### Reversed Hierarchical Content (Severity 8-9)\n\n**Pattern**: Root has extensive technology-specific rules, subdirectories are skeletal.\n\n**Example:**\n- Root: 80 lines of React component guidelines\n- frontend/AGENTS.md: 10 lines saying \"See root for React guidelines\"\n\n**This is BAD** because:\n- Agents working in frontend need to read root file\n- Root file is cluttered with domain-specific details\n- Hierarchy is reversed (specific in root, generic in subdirectory)\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Move React-specific content from root to frontend/AGENTS.md.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Missing Context-Specific Guidance (Severity 7-8)\n\n**Pattern**: Root is appropriately generic, but subdirectories lack context-specific content.\n\n**Example:**\n- Root: Generic rules about testing (appropriate)\n- frontend/AGENTS.md: Also generic \"write tests\" (missing React Testing Library details)\n- backend/AGENTS.md: Also generic \"write tests\" (missing pytest details)\n\n**This is BAD** because:\n- Subdirectories should provide context-specific guidance\n- Without specifics, agents must guess implementation details\n- Defeats the purpose of having separate files\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Add React-specific testing guidance (React Testing Library, component patterns) to frontend/AGENTS.md.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Inconsistent Specialization (Severity 6-7)\n\n**Pattern**: Some subdirectories have context-specific content, similar subdirectories don't.\n\n**Example:**\n- frontend/AGENTS.md: 100 lines of React details (good)\n- backend/AGENTS.md: 15 lines of generic rules (inconsistent)\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Add Python/FastAPI-specific guidance to backend/AGENTS.md to match detail level of frontend/AGENTS.md.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Good Hierarchical Patterns (DO NOT REPORT)\n\nThese are CORRECT hierarchical documentation patterns:\n\n✅ **Root: 20 lines generic, Subdirectory: 100 lines specific**\n- Root has universal rules (git, testing philosophy)\n- Subdirectory has technology-specific details\n- Length difference is APPROPRIATE\n\n✅ **Root: 50 lines, Subdirectory: 30 lines**\n- Root has project structure, setup, workflows\n- Subdirectory has focused context-specific rules\n- Appropriate if both have right content for scope\n\n✅ **Root mentions subdirectories with cross-references**\n- \"See frontend/AGENTS.md for React guidelines\"\n- Clear hierarchical structure\n- This is GOOD design\n\n---\n\nFor cross-file issues, include:\n- `\"affectedFiles\": [\"frontend/AGENTS.md\", \"backend/AGENTS.md\"]` - list of all affected file paths\n- `\"isMultiFile\": true` - marker for cross-file issues\n- `\"location\"` - array of location objects, each with proper \"file\" field\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\n1. **Check language first** - If not English, return `[]`\n2. **Evaluate for Completeness & Balance issues** (patterns 10.1-10.2 above)\n3. **If multiple files provided**, also check for cross-file completeness issues\n4. **Use category**: `\"Completeness & Balance\"`\n5. **Assign severity** 6-10 only\n6. **Output ONLY a valid JSON array** - No explanations, no markdown, no code blocks, no prose.

extract from FILE header\n    \"start\": 10,\n    \"end\": 15\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPay attention to:\n- File boundaries marked by `================================================================================`\n- File path appears in both start and end separators\n- Periodic reminders throughout long files: `--- Still in file: path ---`\n\n### AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md Pair Exemption\n\n**CRITICAL**: When AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md exist in the same directory with identical or similar content, this is INTENTIONAL and should NOT be flagged.\n\nThese files serve as mirrors for different AI agent compatibility:\n- AGENTS.md: Standard for general AI coding agents\n- CLAUDE.md: Standard for Claude Code specifically\n\n**DO NOT flag duplication between colocated AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md pairs.**\n**DO flag inconsistencies** that could cause different agent behaviors.\n\n### Packmind Standards Sections (EXCLUDED FROM COMPARISON)\n\n**CRITICAL**: When comparing AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md files for consistency or missing content, **completely exclude Packmind Standards sections** from the comparison.\n\n**Why:**\n- Packmind tool intentionally deploys standards only to AGENTS.md files\n- CLAUDE.md files will not contain Packmind standards by design\n- This difference is intentional, not a documentation gap\n\n**Detection - Content to Skip:**\n\n1. **HTML Comment Markers:**\n   ```html\n   <!-- start: Packmind standards -->\n   ...content here...\n   <!-- end: Packmind standards -->\n   ```\n\n2. **Section Headings:**\n   - `# Packmind Standards` or `## Packmind Standards`\n   - All content until the next major heading or end of file\n\n**How to Handle:**\n\n- When AGENTS.md contains Packmind Standards sections but CLAUDE.md does not: **DO NOT flag as missing content**\n- When comparing file completeness: **Exclude Packmind content from both files before comparison**\n- Content differences related to Packmind standards are **NEVER an issue**\n\n**Example - DO NOT REPORT:**\n\n```\nFILE 1: apps/frontend/AGENTS.md (140 lines)\n[38 lines of regular content]\n\n<!-- start: Packmind standards -->\n## Testing Standards\n[100 lines of Packmind-generated standards]\n<!-- end: Packmind standards -->\n\nFILE 2: apps/frontend/CLAUDE.md (38 lines)\n[38 lines of regular content - same as AGENTS.md]\n```\n\n**This is CORRECT** - CLAUDE.md has the same manual content as AGENTS.md. The missing Packmind section is intentional.\n\n**DO NOT flag:**\n- \"CLAUDE.md lacks X standards present in AGENTS.md\" when X is Packmind content\n- \"CLAUDE.md is shorter than AGENTS.md\" when the length difference is Packmind content\n- Any inconsistency where the missing content is within Packmind markers or under a Packmind Standards heading\n\n---\n\n### Cross-File Completeness Issues\n\n**CRITICAL**: Length differences alone are NOT problems. Focus on content appropriateness.\n\n#### Reversed Hierarchical Content (Severity 8-9)\n\n**Pattern**: Root has extensive technology-specific rules, subdirectories are skeletal.\n\n**Example:**\n- Root: 80 lines of React component guidelines\n- frontend/AGENTS.md: 10 lines saying \"See root for React guidelines\"\n\n**This is BAD** because:\n- Agents working in frontend need to read root file\n- Root file is cluttered with domain-specific details\n- Hierarchy is reversed (specific in root, generic in subdirectory)\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Move React-specific content from root to frontend/AGENTS.md.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Missing Context-Specific Guidance (Severity 7-8)\n\n**Pattern**: Root is appropriately generic, but subdirectories lack context-specific content.\n\n**Example:**\n- Root: Generic rules about testing (appropriate)\n- frontend/AGENTS.md: Also generic \"write tests\" (missing React Testing Library details)\n- backend/AGENTS.md: Also generic \"write tests\" (missing pytest details)\n\n**This is BAD** because:\n- Subdirectories should provide context-specific guidance\n- Without specifics, agents must guess implementation details\n- Defeats the purpose of having separate files\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Add React-specific testing guidance (React Testing Library, component patterns) to frontend/AGENTS.md.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Inconsistent Specialization (Severity 6-7)\n\n**Pattern**: Some subdirectories have context-specific content, similar subdirectories don't.\n\n**Example:**\n- frontend/AGENTS.md: 100 lines of React details (good)\n- backend/AGENTS.md: 15 lines of generic rules (inconsistent)\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Add Python/FastAPI-specific guidance to backend/AGENTS.md to match detail level of frontend/AGENTS.md.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Good Hierarchical Patterns (DO NOT REPORT)\n\nThese are CORRECT hierarchical documentation patterns:\n\n✅ **Root: 20 lines generic, Subdirectory: 100 lines specific**\n- Root has universal rules (git, testing philosophy)\n- Subdirectory has technology-specific details\n- Length difference is APPROPRIATE\n\n✅ **Root: 50 lines, Subdirectory: 30 lines**\n- Root has project structure, setup, workflows\n- Subdirectory has focused context-specific rules\n- Appropriate if both have right content for scope\n\n✅ **Root mentions subdirectories with cross-references**\n- \"See frontend/AGENTS.md for React guidelines\"\n- Clear hierarchical structure\n- This is GOOD design\n\n---\n\nFor cross-file issues, include:\n- `\"affectedFiles\": [\"frontend/AGENTS.md\", \"backend/AGENTS.md\"]` - list of all affected file paths\n- `\"isMultiFile\": true` - marker for cross-file issues\n- `\"location\"` - array of location objects, each with proper \"file\" field\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\n1. **Check language first** - If not English, return `[]`\n2. **Evaluate for Completeness & Balance issues** (patterns 10.1-10.2 above)\n3. **If multiple files provided**, also check for cross-file completeness issues\n4. **Use category**: `\"Completeness & Balance\"`\n5. **Assign severity** 6-10 only\n6. **Output ONLY a valid JSON array** - No explanations, no markdown, no code blocks, no prose. Return ONLY the JSON array itself starting with `[` and ending with `]`.\n\n**AGENTS.md file content(s) to evaluate:**\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":189,"oldLines":6,"newStart":189,"newLines":78,"lines":[" "," ---"," ","+### 10.4 LLM-Generated Verbal Bloat","+","+AGENTS.md files are frequently generated by LLMs and AI agents.

Severity 8)\n\n**Root AGENTS.md (100 lines):**\n```markdown\n# Development Guidelines\n\n## React Component Guidelines\n- Use functional components with hooks\n- State with useState, shared state with Context\n- Chakra UI for styling with theme tokens\n- Component structure: MyComponent.tsx + MyComponent.test.tsx\n- Props should be typed interfaces\n- Use React.memo for expensive components\n- Testing with React Testing Library\n\n[... 60 more lines of React-specific details ...]\n\n## Git Workflow\n[... 20 lines ...]\n```\n\n**frontend/AGENTS.md (15 lines):**\n```markdown\n# Frontend\n\nSee root AGENTS.md for React guidelines.\n\n## Local Development\nnpm run dev\nServer runs on http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n**Why This Should Be Flagged (Section 10.3, Severity 8):**\n- Root contains 60+ lines of React-specific content\n- Frontend file is skeletal (15 lines, references root)\n- Reversed hierarchy: specific in root, generic in subdirectory\n- Root should have universal rules, frontend should have React details\n\n**Recommendation**: Move all React guidelines from root to frontend/AGENTS.md.\n\n---\n\n## Severity Guidelines for Completeness & Balance\n\n| Score | Level | Description |\n|-------|-------|-------------|\n| **8-10** | High | File essentially empty or critically lacks content (missing multiple key sections, no executable examples) |\n| **6-7** | Medium | Missing 1-2 important sections or sparse content in existing sections |\n| **5** | Low | Minor gaps in coverage that could be improved |\n| **≤4** | DO NOT REPORT | |\n\n### For Over-Detailed Content\n\n| Score | Level | Description |\n|-------|-------|-------------|\n| **8-10** | High | Extensive redundancy with tutorial-style content throughout |\n| **6-7** | Medium | Heavy tutorial-style content or some sections overly verbose |\n| **5** | Low | Minor verbosity that could be trimmed |\n| **≤4** | DO NOT REPORT | |\n\n\n## Multi-File Evaluation Mode\n\nWhen multiple AGENTS.md files are provided, they are separated by prominent dividers:\n\n```\n================================================================================\nFILE 1: AGENTS.md\n================================================================================\n[content with line numbers]\n================================================================================\nEND OF FILE 1: AGENTS.md\n================================================================================\n\n================================================================================\nFILE 2: packages/ui/AGENTS.md\n================================================================================\n[content with line numbers]\n================================================================================\nEND OF FILE 2: packages/ui/AGENTS.md\n================================================================================\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: File Reference Requirements**\n\nEvery issue MUST include the file path in the location object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"location\": {\n    \"file\": \"packages/ui/AGENTS.md\",  // ← MANDATORY - extract from FILE header\n    \"start\": 10,\n    \"end\": 15\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPay attention to:\n- File boundaries marked by `================================================================================`\n- File path appears in both start and end separators\n- Periodic reminders throughout long files: `--- Still in file: path ---`\n\n### AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md Pair Exemption\n\n**CRITICAL**: When AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md exist in the same directory with identical or similar content, this is INTENTIONAL and should NOT be flagged.\n\nThese files serve as mirrors for different AI agent compatibility:\n- AGENTS.md: Standard for general AI coding agents\n- CLAUDE.md: Standard for Claude Code specifically\n\n**DO NOT flag duplication between colocated AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md pairs.**\n**DO flag inconsistencies** that could cause different agent behaviors.\n\n### Packmind Standards Sections (EXCLUDED FROM COMPARISON)\n\n**CRITICAL**: When comparing AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md files for consistency or missing content, **completely exclude Packmind Standards sections** from the comparison.\n\n**Why:**\n- Packmind tool intentionally deploys standards only to AGENTS.md files\n- CLAUDE.md files will not contain Packmind standards by design\n- This difference is intentional, not a documentation gap\n\n**Detection - Content to Skip:**\n\n1. **HTML Comment Markers:**\n   ```html\n   <!-- start: Packmind standards -->\n   ...content here...\n   <!-- end: Packmind standards -->\n   ```\n\n2. **Section Headings:**\n   - `# Packmind Standards` or `## Packmind Standards`\n   - All content until the next major heading or end of file\n\n**How to Handle:**\n\n- When AGENTS.md contains Packmind Standards sections but CLAUDE.md does not: **DO NOT flag as missing content**\n- When comparing file completeness: **Exclude Packmind content from both files before comparison**\n- Content differences related to Packmind standards are **NEVER an issue**\n\n**Example - DO NOT REPORT:**\n\n```\nFILE 1: apps/frontend/AGENTS.md (140 lines)\n[38 lines of regular content]\n\n<!-- start: Packmind standards -->\n## Testing Standards\n[100 lines of Packmind-generated standards]\n<!-- end: Packmind standards -->\n\nFILE 2: apps/frontend/CLAUDE.md (38 lines)\n[38 lines of regular content - same as AGENTS.md]\n```\n\n**This is CORRECT** - CLAUDE.md has the same manual content as AGENTS.md. The missing Packmind section is intentional.\n\n**DO NOT flag:**\n- \"CLAUDE.md lacks X standards present in AGENTS.md\" when X is Packmind content\n- \"CLAUDE.md is shorter than AGENTS.md\" when the length difference is Packmind content\n- Any inconsistency where the missing content is within Packmind markers or under a Packmind Standards heading\n\n---\n\n### Cross-File Completeness Issues\n\n**CRITICAL**: Length differences alone are NOT problems. Focus on content appropriateness.\n\n#### Reversed Hierarchical Content (Severity 8-9)\n\n**Pattern**: Root has extensive technology-specific rules, subdirectories are skeletal.\n\n**Example:**\n- Root: 80 lines of React component guidelines\n- frontend/AGENTS.md: 10 lines saying \"See root for React guidelines\"\n\n**This is BAD** because:\n- Agents working in frontend need to read root file\n- Root file is cluttered with domain-specific details\n- Hierarchy is reversed (specific in root, generic in subdirectory)\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Move React-specific content from root to frontend/AGENTS.md.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Missing Context-Specific Guidance (Severity 7-8)\n\n**Pattern**: Root is appropriately generic, but subdirectories lack context-specific content.\n\n**Example:**\n- Root: Generic rules about testing (appropriate)\n- frontend/AGENTS.md: Also generic \"write tests\" (missing React Testing Library details)\n- backend/AGENTS.md: Also generic \"write tests\" (missing pytest details)\n\n**This is BAD** because:\n- Subdirectories should provide context-specific guidance\n- Without specifics, agents must guess implementation details\n- Defeats the purpose of having separate files\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Add React-specific testing guidance (React Testing Library, component patterns) to frontend/AGENTS.md.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Inconsistent Specialization (Severity 6-7)\n\n**Pattern**: Some subdirectories have context-specific content, similar subdirectories don't.\n\n**Example:**\n- frontend/AGENTS.md: 100 lines of React details (good)\n- backend/AGENTS.md: 15 lines of generic rules (inconsistent)\n\n**Recommendation**: \"Add Python/FastAPI-specific guidance to backend/AGENTS.md to match detail level of frontend/AGENTS.md.\"\n\n---\n\n#### Good Hierarchical Patterns (DO NOT REPORT)\n\nThese are CORRECT hierarchical documentation patterns:\n\n✅ **Root: 20 lines generic, Subdirectory: 100 lines specific**\n- Root has universal rules (git, testing philosophy)\n- Subdirectory has technology-specific details\n- Length difference is APPROPRIATE\n\n✅ **Root: 50 lines, Subdirectory: 30 lines**\n- Root has project structure, setup, workflows\n- Subdirectory has focused context-specific rules\n- Appropriate if both have right content for scope\n\n✅ **Root mentions subdirectories with cross-references**\n- \"See frontend/AGENTS.md for React guidelines\"\n- Clear hierarchical structure\n- This is GOOD design\n\n---\n\nFor cross-file issues, include:\n- `\"affectedFiles\": [\"frontend/AGENTS.md\", \"backend/AGENTS.md\"]` - list of all affected file paths\n- `\"isMultiFile\": true` - marker for cross-file issues\n- `\"location\"` - array of location objects, each with proper \"file\" field\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\n1. **Check language first** - If not English, return `[]`\n2. **Evaluate for Completeness & Balance issues** (patterns 10.1-10.2 above)\n3. **If multiple files provided**, also check for cross-file completeness issues\n4. **Use category**: `\"Completeness & Balance\"`\n5. **Assign severity** 6-10 only\n6. **Output ONLY a valid JSON array** - No explanations, no markdown, no code blocks, no prose. Return ONLY the JSON array itself starting with `[` and ending with `]`.\n\n**AGENTS.md file content(s) to evaluate:**\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":624,"oldLines":7,"newStart":624,"newLines":7,"lines":[" ## Your Task"," "," 1. **Check language first** - If not English, return `[]`","-2. **Evaluate for Completeness & Balance issues** (patterns 10.1-10.2 above)","+2. **Evaluate for Completeness & Balance issues** (patterns 10.1-10.4 above)"," 3. **If multiple files provided**, also check for cross-file completeness issues"," 4. **Use category**: `\"Completeness & Balance\"`"," 5. **Assign severity** 6-10 only"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"ffd16563-6881-468f-8dbe-ecdd7a37c71f"}

Changes to `tailwind.config.js` (like adding custom colors) won't appear in the browser until the CSS is regenerated.\n\n**When to rebuild**:\n- After modifying `frontend/tailwind.config.js`\n- When new Tailwind utility classes aren't showing up\n- When color/theme changes don't appear in the browser\n\n## CSS Build Architecture\n\nThe application uses a **unified Tailwind CSS build** across all serving modes:\n\n### Development Mode\n\n- **Source**: `frontend/src/styles.css` (Tailwind directives + custom CSS)\n- **Output**: `frontend/dist/output.css` (85KB unminified)\n- **Generated by**: `tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./dist/output.css`\n- **Referenced in**: `frontend/index.html` via `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./dist/output.css\">`\n- **Served from**: Frontend dev server at `localhost:3000`\n\n### Production Mode\n\n- **Source**: `frontend/src/styles.css` (same as dev)\n- **Output**: `frontend/dist/styles.css` (58KB minified)\n- **Generated by**: `tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./dist/styles.css --minify`\n- **Referenced in**: `frontend/dist/index.html` via `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./styles.css\">`\n- **Embedded in**: `src/embedded/frontend-assets.ts` for binary distribution\n\n### Important: Do NOT Import CSS in React Components\n\n- CSS is loaded via HTML `<link>` tags, NOT via `import './styles.css'` in components\n- This prevents Bun's build system from extracting CSS into chunk files (e.g., `chunk-abc123.css`)\n- Keeps CSS generation under explicit Tailwind CLI control\n- Ensures consistency between dev and production CSS\n\n### Production Build Pipeline: CSS Generation\n\nThe `build:prod` pipeline in `frontend/package.json` handles CSS with these steps:\n\n1. **`build:prod:js`** - Bundles JavaScript with `--no-bundle-css` flag\n   - Creates `App.[hash].js` only, NO chunk CSS files\n   - This flag is critical to prevent Bun from extracting CSS\n\n2. **`build:prod:css`** - Generates complete Tailwind CSS\n   - Creates `styles.css` with all required utilities\n   - Minified and ready for production\n\n3. **`build:prod:html`** - Rewrites HTML references\n   - Removes old dev CSS references\n   - Adds reference to `styles.css`\n   - Inserts bundled JavaScript filename\n\n4. **`build:prod:verify`** - Validates the build\n   - Ensures HTML references `styles.css`\n   - Ensures no `chunk-*.css` files are referenced\n   - Ensures no dev `output.css` remains\n\n## Production Build Pipeline\n\n**CRITICAL**: Always use `bun run build` for production builds. Never use `build:binaries` directly.\n\n### Build Pipeline Stages\n\nThe full build process runs these steps in order:\n\n```\nclean → generate:version → build:frontend → generate:embedded → build:binaries\n```\n\n1. **`clean`** ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**\n   - Removes `dist/` (backend build output and binaries)\n   - Removes `frontend/dist/` (frontend build output)\n   - Removes generated embedded assets (`frontend-assets.ts`, `prompts-assets.ts`)\n   - **Ensures a completely fresh build with no stale files**\n\n2. **`build:frontend`**\n   - Wipes and recreates `frontend/dist/` directory\n   - Compiles React app with hashed filenames (e.g., `App.[hash].js`)\n   - Builds minified Tailwind CSS as `styles.css`\n   - Copies public assets\n\n3. **`generate:embedded`**\n   - Reads `frontend/dist/` directory\n   - Embeds all assets as strings into `src/embedded/frontend-assets.ts`\n   - Creates importable TypeScript modules with base64-encoded binaries\n\n4. **`build:binaries`**\n   - Compiles `src/index.ts` (which imports embedded assets)\n   - Creates standalone executables for all platforms\n   - Output: `dist/bin/context-evaluator-{platform}`\n\n### Why You MUST Clean Before Building\n\n**Problem**: Development mode (`bun run dev`) and production mode use different files:\n- **Dev mode** serves `frontend/dist/output.css` (development CSS)\n- **Production mode** embeds `frontend/dist/styles.css` (minified CSS)\n- Stale files from previous builds can cause UI inconsistencies\n\n**Solution**: The `clean` script ensures:\n- No mix of dev and production files\n- Frontend is completely rebuilt from scratch\n- Embedded assets reflect the actual production build\n- Binaries contain the correct UI code\n\n### Why build:binaries Alone Is Broken\n\nIf you run `bun run build:binaries` directly:\n- ❌ Frontend is **not** rebuilt\n- ❌ Old dev files may still exist in `frontend/dist/`\n- ❌ Embedded assets are **not** regenerated\n- ❌ Binaries contain **stale/mixed** UI code\n- ❌ UI will look **different** between dev and production\n\n**The binaries will appear to build successfully, but will serve incorrect frontend code.**\n\n### Correct Build Workflow\n\n**Always do a full clean build:**\n```bash\nbun run build\n```\n\n**Never skip the clean step** - it prevents dev/production UI mismatches.\n\n**After the build:**\n- Test the binary: `./dist/bin/context-evaluator-darwin-arm64 api`\n- Verify UI matches development mode\n- Check that all CSS and assets load correctly\n\n**Development iteration** (no binary needed):\n```bash\nbun run dev              # Hot reload for frontend + backend\n```\n\n**If you suspect stale files:**\n```bash\nbun run clean && bun run build\n```\n\n---\n\n# Architecture Overview\n\n## Dual Execution Modes\n\nThe application runs in two modes from a single entry point (`src/index.ts`):\n- **CLI Mode**: Direct terminal evaluation via Commander.js\n- **API Mode**: Web server with REST API + React frontend\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── index.ts              # Entry point (routes to CLI or API)\n├── cli/                  # CLI-specific code\n│   ├── commands/         # Command handlers (evaluate-command.ts)\n│   └── output/           # Report formatters (terminal, JSON, raw)\n├── api/                  # Web API server\n│   ├── routes/           # REST endpoints\n│   ├── jobs/             # Job queue management\n│   ├── db/               # In-memory evaluation repository\n│   └── sse/              # Server-Sent Events for progress\n├── shared/               # Core evaluation engine (used by both modes)\n│   ├── evaluation/       # Core logic (engine, runner, config)\n│   ├── providers/        # AI provider abstraction (claude, opencode)\n│   ├── claude/           # Prompt building and response parsing\n│   ├── file-system/      # File discovery and git operations\n│   └── types/            # Shared TypeScript types\n├── web/                  # React frontend (browser build)\n└── embedded/             # Single binary asset bundling\n\nfrontend/                 # Separate frontend dev build\nprompts/evaluators/       # 18 markdown evaluator prompts\n```\n\n## TypeScript Path Aliases\n\n```\n@shared/* → ./src/shared/*\n@cli/*    → ./src/cli/*\n@api/*    → ./src/api/*\n@web/*    → ./src/web/*\n```\n\n## AI Providers\n\nThis tool supports multiple AI providers for evaluation:\n\n### Claude Code (default)\n- **CLI**: `claude`\n- **Usage**: `--agent claude` (or omit for default)\n- **Setup**: Install from https://claude.ai/code\n\n### OpenCode\n- **CLI**: `opencode`\n- **Usage**: `--agent opencode`\n- **Model**: openai/gpt-5.2-codex\n\n### Cursor Agent\n- **CLI**: `agent`\n- **Usage**: `--agent cursor`\n- **Setup**: Install Cursor CLI from https://cursor.com\n- **Requirements**: `agent` command must be in PATH\n- **Verify**: `agent --version`\n\n### OpenAI Codex\n- **CLI**: `codex`\n- **Usage**: `--agent codex`\n- **Setup**: Install from https://docs.openai.com/codex\n- **Requirements**: `codex` command must be in PATH\n- **Authentication**: Set `CODEX_API_KEY` environment variable or run `codex login`\n- **Verify**: `codex --version`\n\nCheck available providers:\n```bash\nbun run src/index.ts cli evaluate --help\n```\n\n---\n\n# Evaluation Engine\n\n## Core Flow\n\n1.

Choose evaluation mode (unified vs independent based on token count)\n5. Run all evaluators with file filtering\n6. Parse results, categorize issues (errors vs suggestions)\n7. Optional curation to top N impactful issues\n\n## Evaluator Configuration\n\nEvaluators are defined in `src/shared/evaluation/evaluator-types.ts`:\n- **Errors** (issues to fix): evaluators 01-10, 13, 17, 19\n- **Suggestions** (improvements): evaluators 11, 12, 14, 15\n- `executeIfNoFile` determines if evaluator runs without AGENTS.md\n- **Note**: Evaluator 16 was merged into 03 (command-completeness). Evaluator 18 was removed.\n\n## Evaluator Coverage Areas\n\nThe 17 evaluators are specialized to avoid overlap. Cross-references between evaluators prevent duplicate reporting.\n\n**Content Focus & Command Quality (Clear Boundary):**\n- **01-content-quality** (ERROR): Detects human-focused, README-style, and completely irrelevant content\n  - Catches: Marketing language, social content, historical narratives, completely off-topic material (recipes, personal stories)\n  - Sections: Human-focused content (1.1), vague instructions (1.2), README-style content (1.3), missing critical dev info (1.4), future plans (1.5), skills extraction (1.6)\n  - Boundary: Evaluates content FOCUS and RELEVANCE for AI agents\n- **03-command-completeness** (ERROR): Evaluates quality of documented commands (assumes commands exist and content is technical)\n  - Catches: Unclear commands, missing prerequisites, incomplete setup steps, undocumented env vars, version constraints\n  - Sections: Non-executable commands (3.1), missing success criteria (3.2), missing context (3.3), dependency order (3.4), env vars (3.5), versions (3.6)\n  - Boundary: Evaluates command QUALITY and COMPLETENESS, not content relevance\n  - **Critical Exclusion**: Does NOT flag completely irrelevant content with zero commands → defers to Evaluator 01\n\n**Boundary Rule**: If content has zero commands AND is clearly not technical (recipes, social content) → Evaluator 01. If content has commands but they're unclear/incomplete → Evaluator 03. If technical content lacks commands that should exist → Evaluator 01 (Section 1.4).\n\n**Command & Environment (Merged):**\n- **03-command-completeness** (ERROR): Unified evaluator for all command documentation\n  - Sections: Command clarity (3.1-3.3), dependencies (3.4), env vars (3.5), versions (3.6)\n  - Previously split between 03 and 16, now consolidated\n\n**Code Style Evaluators:**\n- **05-code-style** (ERROR): Evaluates quality of documented code style in AGENTS.md\n- **12-context-gaps** (SUGGESTION, section 12.1): Scans codebase for undocumented code conventions\n  - Complementary: 05 checks documented quality, 12.1 discovers undocumented patterns\n\n**Project Structure Evaluators:**\n- **08-project-structure** (ERROR): Quality of documented structure/organization\n- **11-subdirectory-coverage** (SUGGESTION): Identifies packages needing their own AGENTS.md\n  - Cross-reference: 08 checks docs quality, 11 suggests file creation\n\n**Workflow Evaluators:**\n- **07-workflow-integration** (ERROR): Quality of documented git/CI workflows\n  - **Cross-reference to 03**: Defers undefined workflow commands to Command Completeness evaluator\n  - Focus: Workflow CONTEXT (git conventions, CI/CD, branching), not command definitions\n\n**Language & Clarity:**\n- **06-language-clarity** (ERROR): Ambiguous references, vague language, excessive jargon\n  - **Cross-reference to 03**: Defers command/tool names to Command Completeness evaluator\n  - Focus: Domain terminology and project concepts, not executable commands\n  - ✅ Flags: Domain jargon (acronyms, business terms), ❌ Doesn't flag: Command names\n\n**Security vs Configuration:**\n- **09-security** (ERROR): Exposed credentials, security risks\n  - **Excludes:** Missing env var documentation → see 03-command-completeness (section 3.5)\n\n**Codebase-Scanning Evaluators (Coordinated):**\n- **12-context-gaps**: Framework patterns, architecture, tools, domain conventions\n  - **Excludes:** Testing (→14) and Database (→15)\n- **14-test-patterns-coverage**: All testing patterns (frameworks, mocking, fixtures, E2E)\n- **15-database-patterns-coverage**: All database patterns (ORM, migrations, relationships)\n- **19-outdated-documentation**: Verifies documented paths/commands exist in codebase\n\nThese four evaluators coordinate scanning to avoid duplicate file traversal.\n\n**Database/ORM/Framework Verification:**\n- **19-outdated-documentation** (ERROR, section 19.6): Verifies documented technologies match actual usage\n  - Checks: Database claims (MongoDB vs PostgreSQL), ORM claims (Mongoose vs TypeORM), state management, major libraries\n  - Uses: Import scanning, package.json analysis, Docker Compose inspection, schema file detection\n  - Cross-reference: 12.1 discovers undocumented frameworks, 19.6 verifies documented claims are accurate\n  - Example: \"Docs say MongoDB but codebase uses PostgreSQL\" → 19.6 flags this (severity 9-10)\n\n**Irrelevant Technology Guidelines:**\n- **19-outdated-documentation** (ERROR, section 19.7): Detects guidelines written for wrong technology stack\n  - Catches: Java/Spring guidelines in Node.js project, Python patterns in Go codebase, Angular decorators in React project\n  - Detection: Scans for technology-specific patterns (@Controller, mvn, pip, go build) and compares against actual project tech\n  - Threshold: Requires 3+ distinct technology patterns AND strong evidence of actual project tech (file counts, build configs)\n  - Cross-reference: 01 catches completely off-topic content, 19.6 verifies explicit claims, 19.7 catches wrong-tech guidelines\n  - Example: \"Java @Controller patterns in Node.js/TypeScript project\" → 19.7 flags this (severity 9-10)\n  - **Edge cases**: Does NOT flag monorepos, migration docs, or polyglot projects with multiple legitimate technologies\n\n## File Filtering Strategies\n\nIn `src/shared/evaluation/config.ts`:\n- `ALL_FILES`: Include all discovered files (default)\n- `ROOT_ONLY`: Only use shallowest context file\n- `CUSTOM`: Custom filter function\n\n## File Path Resolution for Multiple AGENTS.md Files\n\nWhen a repository contains multiple AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md files (e.g., root + subdirectories), evaluators may reference files using:\n- **Full relative path** (preferred): `packages/AGENTS.md`\n- **Basename only** (legacy): `AGENTS.md`\n\n**Resolution Convention:**\n- When evaluators use basename-only references (e.g., `\"file\": \"AGENTS.md\"`), the system assumes they mean the **root-level file** (`./AGENTS.md`)\n- If no root-level file exists but multiple subdirectory files match, snippet extraction will fail with an ambiguity error\n- This convention avoids forcing evaluators to use full paths while maintaining clarity\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Logic in `src/shared/claude/response-parser.ts` (populateSnippets function)\n- Warning displayed in `src/shared/evaluation/runner.ts` indicates which file is the default\n\n## Configuration Options Flow\n\n**CRITICAL**: When adding new configuration options in the frontend, you MUST ensure they flow through the entire stack.\n\n### Required Flow Path\n\nFrontend → API → Engine → Runner Functions\n\n**Each layer must explicitly pass the option to the next layer.**\n\n### Implementation Checklist\n\nWhen adding a new evaluation configuration option:\n\n1. **Frontend Layer** (`frontend/src/hooks/useEvaluationApi.ts`):\n   - Add the parameter to `submitJob()` function signature\n   - Include it in the `options` object sent to `/api/evaluate`\n\n2. **API Layer** (`src/api/routes/evaluation.ts`):\n   - Options are automatically passed through in `body.options`\n   - No changes typically needed (options object is forwarded)\n\n3. **Engine Layer** (`src/shared/evaluation/engine.ts`):\n   - **CRITICAL**: Pass the option to runner functions:\n     - `runUnifiedEvaluation()` call (line ~496)\n     - `runAllEvaluators()` call (line ~834)\n   - Add the option to the function call's options object\n\n4. **Runner Layer** (`src/shared/evaluation/runner.ts`):\n   - Accept the option in function parameters\n   - Use it to control evaluation behavior\n\n### Example: evaluatorFilter Option\n\n```typescript\n// Frontend: useEvaluationApi.ts\nsubmitJob(repoUrl, evaluators, provider, evaluatorFilter)\n\n// API: evaluation.ts (automatic passthrough)\nbody.options.evaluatorFilter\n\n// Engine: engine.ts\nconst unifiedResult = await runUnifiedEvaluation(agentsFiles, getRelPath, {\n  // ... other options\n  evaluatorFilter: options.evaluatorFilter, // ← MUST PASS EXPLICITLY\n});\n\nconst evaluations = await runAllEvaluators(filePath, {\n  // ... other options\n  evaluatorFilter: options.evaluatorFilter, // ← MUST PASS EXPLICITLY\n});\n\n// Runner: runner.ts\nexport async function runAllEvaluators(\n  agentsFilePath: string,\n  options: {\n    evaluatorFilter?: EvaluatorFilter, // ← MUST ACCEPT\n    // ... other options\n  }\n)\n```\n\n### Common Mistake\n\n**DO NOT** assume options automatically propagate. Each function call must explicitly include the option in its parameters.\n\n**Bug Example**: The `evaluatorFilter` option was being sent from the frontend and accepted by the API, but the engine wasn't passing it to the runner functions. This caused all 19 evaluators to run instead of respecting the filter selection.\n\n**Fix**: Added explicit `evaluatorFilter: options.evaluatorFilter` to both runner function calls in `engine.ts`.\n\n### Testing\n\nAfter adding a new configuration option:\n1. Add unit tests in the appropriate test files\n2. Verify the option is used at each layer\n3. Test that changing the option produces different behavior\n4. Add regression tests to prevent future breakage\n\n---\n\n# Temporary Data Cleanup\n\n## Automatic Cleanup After Successful Evaluation\n\nAfter successful evaluation completion, temporary data is automatically removed:\n- **Debug output files** (`debug-output/` directory with prompts and responses)\n- **Empty temporary clone directories** (`tmp/clones/` at project root)\n\n**Important:** Database records in `data/evaluations.db` are NOT automatically cleaned up.\n\n## Preserving Debug Output\n\nTo keep debug output for manual inspection:\n- **CLI**: Use `--preserve-debug-output` flag\n- **API**: Set `options.preserveDebugOutput: true` in request body\n\nDebug files are always preserved on evaluation failure for troubleshooting.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe cleanup functionality is implemented in `src/shared/evaluation/cleanup-manager.ts` and integrated into the evaluation engine at `src/shared/evaluation/engine.ts`.\n\nCleanup occurs in the `finally` block of the evaluation engine, ensuring it runs regardless of success or failure (but only removes files on success).\n\n**Cleanup behavior:**\n- On success with `preserveDebugOutput=false`: Cleans debug output and empty directories\n- On success with `preserveDebugOutput=true`: Only cleans empty directories\n- On failure: Preserves all debug data for troubleshooting\n- All cleanup errors are logged but do not affect evaluation results\n\n---\n\n# Runtime Prompt Debugging\n\n## Always-On Persistent Logging\n\nThe evaluation system automatically logs all runtime evaluator prompts to `prompts/debug/` at the project root for real-time debugging purposes. This is a **separate system** from the temporary debug output controlled by the `--debug` flag.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n- **Always enabled**: Runs on every evaluation without configuration\n- **Persistent storage**: Files accumulate over time and are NOT automatically cleaned up\n- **Write-before-execute**: Prompts are written to disk before the AI provider is invoked, ensuring they're preserved even if evaluation crashes\n- **Project root location**: Always saved to `{project-root}/prompts/debug/`, even when evaluating cloned repositories\n\n## Filename Format\n\nPrompts are saved with timestamp-based filenames to track execution history:\n\n```\n{evaluator-name}[-unified]-{ISO-timestamp}.md\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- Independent mode: `content-quality-2026-01-26T15-30-45.md`\n- Unified mode: `command-completeness-unified-2026-01-26T15-31-02.md`\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **Real-time inspection**: View exact prompts sent to AI providers during evaluation\n- **Prompt engineering**: Analyze and improve evaluator prompts based on actual runtime content\n- **Debugging failures**: Prompts are preserved even if evaluation crashes or times out\n- **Historical tracking**: Compare prompts across multiple evaluation runs\n\n## Manual Cleanup\n\nFiles in `prompts/debug/` are never automatically deleted. To clean up:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf prompts/debug/\n```\n\nOr selectively remove old files:\n\n```bash\n# Remove files older than 7 days\nfind prompts/debug/ -name \"*.md\" -mtime +7 -delete\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe logging functionality is implemented in `src/shared/evaluation/runtime-prompt-logger.ts` and integrated into both independent and unified evaluation modes in `src/shared/evaluation/runner.ts`.\n\n**Error handling:** All logging errors are caught and logged as warnings. Failed logging never interrupts evaluation execution.\n\n---\n\n# API Endpoints\n\n```\nPOST /api/evaluate              # Start evaluation job\nGET  /api/evaluate/:jobId       # Get job status\nGET  /api/evaluate/:jobId/progress  # SSE stream for progress\nGET  /api/evaluators            # List available evaluators\nGET  /api/health                # Health check\n```\n\n## Job Status Flow\n\n`queued` → `running` → `completed` (or `failed`)\n\nReal-time progress via Server-Sent Events (7 event types).\n\n---\n\n# Deployment\n\n## Remote API Server Access\n\nBy default, the API server binds to `localhost` for security. This prevents external connections and keeps the server accessible only from the local machine. To accept remote connections on a server or network-accessible host, you must explicitly configure the bind address.\n\n### Option 1: Using CLI Flag (Recommended)\n\nThe `--host` and `--port` flags provide explicit control over the server's network binding:\n\n```bash\n# Bind to all interfaces (accepts connections from any IP)\n./context-evaluator-linux-x64 api --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001\n\n# Bind to a specific IP address\n./context-evaluator-linux-x64 api --host 51.159.136.32 --port 3001\n\n# Development mode (localhost only, default)\n./context-evaluator-linux-x64 api --host localhost --port 3001\n```\n\n**Why use 0.0.0.0?** This special address tells the server to listen on all available network interfaces, making it accessible via any IP address assigned to the machine (public IP, private IP, localhost).\n\n### Option 2: Using Environment Variables\n\nEnvironment variables provide an alternative configuration method:\n\n```bash\n# Using environment variables\nHOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=3001 ./context-evaluator-linux-x64 api\n\n# Or export them first\nexport HOST=0.0.0.0\nexport PORT=3001\n./context-evaluator-linux-x64 api\n```\n\n**Priority:** CLI flags override environment variables, which override defaults.\n\n### Option 3: Using npm Scripts (Development)\n\nFor development with source code:\n\n```bash\n# Public binding (accepts connections from any IP)\nbun run start:public\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nAfter starting the server with public binding, verify it's accessible:\n\n```bash\n# On the server (local test)\ncurl http://localhost:3001/api/health\n\n# From another machine (replace with your server's IP)\ncurl http://51.159.136.32:3001/api/health\n```\n\nExpected response:\n```json\n{\"status\":\"healthy\",\"timestamp\":\"2026-01-28T...\"}\n```\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n**Development:**\n- Keep default `localhost` binding for local development\n- Prevents accidental network exposure during development\n- No firewall configuration needed\n\n**Production:**\n- Use `--host 0.0.0.0` to accept connections on all interfaces\n- Configure firewall rules to restrict access (e.g., allow only specific IPs)\n- Consider using a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Apache) for:\n  - HTTPS/TLS termination\n  - Rate limiting and DDoS protection\n  - Load balancing across multiple instances\n  - Better logging and monitoring\n\n**Example nginx reverse proxy configuration:**\n\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name yourdomain.com;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Firewall Configuration Example (Ubuntu/UFW):**\n\n```bash\n# Allow specific port\nsudo ufw allow 3001/tcp\n\n# Or allow only from specific IP\nsudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 3001\n\n# Check firewall status\nsudo ufw status\n```\n\n### Common Issues\n\n**Problem:** Server starts but external connections fail\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Verify server is bound to `0.0.0.0` or public IP (not `localhost`)\n2. Check firewall allows traffic on the port (`sudo ufw status`)\n3. Ensure cloud provider security groups allow inbound traffic\n4. Verify no other service is using the port (`sudo lsof -i :3001`)\n\n**Problem:** \"Address already in use\" error\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Check if another process is using the port: `sudo lsof -i :3001`\n2. Stop the conflicting process or choose a different port\n3. Kill the process if needed: `kill -9 <PID>`\n\n---\n\n# Frontend Color System\n\n## Centralized Color Palette\n\nAll colors in the frontend MUST be centralized in `frontend/src/styles.css`. Do NOT add inline colors directly in components.\n\n### Color Philosophy\n\nThe UI uses a **minimal, purposeful color palette**:\n- **Primary accent**: Blue (`--color-primary`) - for interactive elements, buttons, links, focus states\n- **Severity indicators**: Red/Orange/Yellow - ONLY for severity levels (Critical/High/Medium)\n- **Neutral UI**: Slate variations - for backgrounds, borders, text, sections\n\n### CSS Classes to Use\n\n**Severity badges** (in `frontend/src/types/evaluation.ts`):\n```ts\ngetSeverityColor(severity)  // Returns: 'severity-badge severity-critical' etc.\ngetSeverityBorderColor(severity)  // Returns RGB value for border colors\n```\n\n**Severity dots** (colored indicators):\n```html\n<div className=\"severity-dot severity-dot-critical\" />\n<div className=\"severity-dot severity-dot-high\" />\n<div className=\"severity-dot severity-dot-medium\" />\n<div className=\"severity-dot severity-dot-low\" />\n```\n\n**Info sections** (unified neutral style):\n```html\n<div className=\"info-section\">\n  <div className=\"flex items-start gap-2\">\n    <svg className=\"info-section-icon\">...</svg>\n    <div>\n      <p className=\"info-section-header\">Section Title</p>\n      <p className=\"info-section-content\">Content here</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Stat cards** (for summary metrics with severity tints):\n```html\n<div className=\"stat-card-critical\">...</div>\n<div className=\"stat-card-high\">...</div>\n<div className=\"stat-card-medium\">...</div>\n```\n\n### Do NOT:\n- Add `bg-purple-*`, `bg-green-*`, `bg-amber-*`, `bg-cyan-*`, etc. inline in components\n- Use gradients like `bg-gradient-to-br from-X-500 to-Y-600` for decoration\n- Use emoji as severity indicators (use `.severity-dot` classes instead)\n- Define colors inline using Tailwind color classes without good reason\n\n### Do:\n- Use the predefined CSS classes from `styles.css`\n- Keep the color palette limited to blue (primary) + slate (neutral) + severity colors\n- Let icons and labels differentiate sections, not colors\n- Add any new shared color classes to `styles.css` first\n\n---\n\n# Frontend Typography System\n\n## Centralized Font Sizes\n\nAll font sizes in the frontend MUST use the centralized typography system in `frontend/src/styles.css`. Do NOT use arbitrary or hardcoded font sizes.\n\n### Typography Scale (CSS Variables)\n\n```css\n--font-size-xs: 0.75rem;   /* 12px - captions, metadata */\n--font-size-sm: 0.875rem;  /* 14px - body text, labels */\n--font-size-base: 1rem;    /* 16px - standard content */\n--font-size-lg: 1.125rem;  /* 18px - card headers */\n--font-size-xl: 1.25rem;   /* 20px - section headers */\n--font-size-2xl: 1.5rem;   /* 24px - stat numbers */\n--font-size-3xl: 1.875rem; /* 30px - page titles */\n```\n\n### Semantic Typography Classes\n\nUse these classes for consistent text styling across the app:\n\n| Class | Use Case | Size |\n|-------|----------|------|\n| `.text-title` | Page titles | 3xl, bold |\n| `.text-heading` | Section headers (h2) | xl, bold |\n| `.text-subheading` | Card/panel headers (h3) | lg, bold |\n| `.text-card-title` | Card titles, emphasized | base, semibold |\n| `.text-body` | Primary body text | sm, slate-300 |\n| `.text-body-muted` | Secondary body text | sm, slate-400 |\n| `.text-caption` | Small text, metadata | xs, slate-400 |\n| `.text-label` | Input labels | sm, semibold |\n| `.text-label-upper` | Uppercase section labels | xs, uppercase, tracking |\n| `.text-stat` | Stat/metric numbers | 2xl, bold |\n| `.text-code` | Inline code, monospace | xs, mono |\n\n### Component Classes with Typography\n\nThese component classes include proper font sizing:\n- `.input-field` - includes `text-sm`\n- `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary` - includes font sizing\n- `.badge` - includes `text-xs`\n- `.info-section-header` - includes `text-xs`\n- `.info-section-content` - includes `text-sm`\n- `.tab-button` - includes `text-sm`\n\n### Do NOT:\n- Use arbitrary sizes like `text-[14px]` or `text-[0.9rem]`\n- Mix different size conventions within similar components\n- Hardcode font sizes without using CSS variables or Tailwind classes\n\n### Do:\n- Use Tailwind's standard size classes (`text-xs`, `text-sm`, `text-base`, etc.)\n- Prefer semantic typography classes for common patterns\n- Ensure form inputs use consistent sizing (`.input-field` class)\n- Add new typography patterns to `styles.css` first\n\n<!-- rtk-instructions v2 -->\n# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands\n\n## Golden Rule\n\n**Always prefix commands with `rtk`**. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.\n\n**Important**: Even in command chains with `&&`, use `rtk`:\n```bash\n# ❌ Wrong\ngit add . && git commit -m \"msg\" && git push\n\n# ✅ Correct\nrtk git add . && rtk git commit -m \"msg\" && rtk git push\n```\n\n## RTK Commands by Workflow\n\n### Build & Compile (80-90% savings)\n```bash\nrtk cargo build         # Cargo build output\nrtk cargo check         # Cargo check output\nrtk cargo clippy        # Clippy warnings grouped by file (80%)\nrtk tsc                 # TypeScript errors grouped by file/code (83%)\nrtk lint                # ESLint/Biome violations grouped (84%)\nrtk prettier --check    # Files needing format only (70%)\nrtk next build          # Next.js build with route metrics (87%)\n```\n\n### Test (90-99% savings)\n```bash\nrtk cargo test          # Cargo test failures only (90%)\nrtk vitest run          # Vitest failures only (99.5%)\nrtk playwright test     # Playwright failures only (94%)\nrtk test <cmd>          # Generic test wrapper -
