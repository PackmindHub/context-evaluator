Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Add LLM-Generated Bloat Detection to Evaluator 10

## Context

AGENTS.md files are most often generated by LLMs and agents themselves. This means they frequently contain verbose padding, boilerplate preambles, unnecessary justifications, and obvious-for-AI explanations that waste context window tokens. Currently, no evaluator specifically targets these phrase-level bloat patterns. The goal is to detect obvious, clear-cut cases without being too aggressive.

## Approach: New Section 10.4 in `completeness.md`

Add a single new section **10.4 - LLM-Generated Verbal Bloat** to `prompts/evaluators/completeness.md`. This fits naturally alongside the existing content balance axis (10.1 too short, 10.2 too verbose/tutorial, 10.3 wrong placement, 10.4 inflated prose).

### Boundary with Existing Sections

| Existing | New 10.4 |
|---|---|
| **10.2** - Structural over-documentation (500-line Node.js tutorial, teaching basic concepts) | **10.4** - Phrase-level noise (padding wrappers, preambles, tool definitions) |
| **01.2** - Vague instructions that are non-actionable ("follow best practices") | **10.4** - Verbose-but-clear instructions that could be 80% shorter |
| **06.2** - Imperatives without specificity ("never do X" with no alternative) | **10.4** - Clear instructions wrapped in unnecessary filler words |

### Five Detection Patterns

**A. Document-Level Boilerplate Preambles** - "This document provides comprehensive guidance...", "The following sections outline..."
- Bad: `This document provides comprehensive guidance to AI coding agents working on this codebase.` then `## Setup` with `npm install`
- Good: Just `## Setup` with `npm install`

**B. Verbose Padding Phrases** - "It is important to note that...", "Please ensure that you always...", "Developers should be aware that..."
- Bad: `It is important to note that you must run npm run lint before committing`
- Good: `Run npm run lint before committing`

**C. Unnecessary Justifications** - History/rationale paragraphs explaining WHY a rule exists when agents just need WHAT to do
- Bad: `We use ESLint because it helps maintain code quality and catches bugs early. It was adopted in 2021 after several production issues...`
- Good: `ESLint config: .eslintrc.json. Run: npm run lint`
- Exception: Brief 1-sentence "why" for non-obvious behavior is OK

**D. Stating the Obvious for AI Agents** - Wikipedia-style definitions of well-known tools (Git, npm, Jest, Docker, etc.)
- Bad: `Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files...`
- Good: Just provide the git workflow commands
- Exception: Proprietary/internal tools DO need explanations

**E. Intra-File Concept Repetition** - Same instruction rephrased in 3+ sections within one file
- Bad: Lint requirement stated in Quick Start, Development Workflow, AND Code Quality sections
- Good: Single mention in the most prominent location

### Severity Thresholds (Conservative)

| Score | Description |
|---|---|
| 8-9 | Multiple patterns pervasive throughout file |
| 7 | One pattern clearly pervasive (>10 instances) or two patterns appear repeatedly |
| 6 | One pattern in moderate but notable way (5-10 instances) |
| ≤5 | DO NOT REPORT |

**Key calibration**: Report ONE consolidated issue per file bundling all instances. Minimum ~5 phrase-level instances or 3+ sections affected before reporting.

## Changes Required

### 1. `prompts/evaluators/completeness.md`
- **Insert** new section 10.4 after section 10.3 (before "Content Quality Indicators" section at ~line 192)
- Content: Full section with detection signals, 5 patterns (A-E) with examples, severity guidelines, cross-evaluator scope notes, and explicit DO NOT flag lists
- **Update** line 555: change `(patterns 10.1-10.2 above)` to `(patterns 10.1-10.4 above)`

### 2. `CLAUDE.md` (evaluator coverage documentation)
- Add entry for new section under evaluator 10: `10.4 - LLM-Generated Verbal Bloat`

### No TypeScript Changes Needed
- `evaluator-types.ts` already has `completeness.md` configured as `error` type
- Section numbering is only in JSON output from the LLM, not in routing/filtering logic
- No new evaluator file = no config changes

## Verification

1. Run `bun run test` to ensure no regressions
2. Run `bun run lint` to ensure formatting is clean
3. Test manually by running an evaluation against a known verbose AGENTS.md file to verify the evaluator picks up 10.4 patterns
