# Bug Fix: "Evaluate Impact" Evaluates Original Files Instead of Patched Files

## Context

When clicking "Evaluate Impact" after a remediation, the user expects the evaluation to run on the **post-remediation state** (patched files). Instead, the new evaluation runs on the **original unpatched repository**, so issues that were fixed still appear as unfixed. This explains why evaluation `aca7b721` still flagged "Conflicting AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md files" even though the remediation had correctly set `CLAUDE.md = @AGENTS.md`.

## Root Cause

**Two-part bug:**

### Part 1 — `remediation.ts` passes both `repositoryUrl` AND `localPath`

In `src/api/routes/remediation.ts` (the `evaluateImpact` method, ~line 611):
```typescript
const jobId = await this.jobManager.submitJob({
  localPath: cloneResult.path,   // patched clone ← correct
  repositoryUrl: repoUrl,        // original repo URL ← should NOT be here
  ...
});
```

### Part 2 — `engine.ts` prioritizes `repositoryUrl` over `localPath`

In `src/shared/evaluation/engine.ts` (~line 680):
```typescript
if (request.repositoryUrl) {
  // Clones fresh from original repo ← takes this branch
  workingDir = cloneResult.path;
} else if (request.localPath) {
  workingDir = resolve(request.localPath); // ← never reached
}
```

When both are provided, `repositoryUrl` wins and the engine clones fresh from the original repository, **discarding the patched clone entirely**.

## Fix

Single-file change in `src/api/routes/remediation.ts`: remove `repositoryUrl` from the `submitJob` call inside `evaluateImpact`.

**File**: `src/api/routes/remediation.ts`
**Change**: Remove `repositoryUrl: repoUrl` from the job submission in `evaluateImpact`.

The `localPath` alone is sufficient — it points to the already-cloned, already-patched directory. The engine's `else if (request.localPath)` branch will then be taken, evaluating the correct patched state.

```typescript
// Before (buggy)
const jobId = await this.jobManager.submitJob({
  localPath: cloneResult.path,
  repositoryUrl: repoUrl,   // ← REMOVE THIS LINE
  options: { selectedEvaluators: parentEvaluatorIds },
  _cleanupFn: cloneResult.cleanup,
  _parentEvaluationId: remediation.evaluationId,
  _sourceRemediationId: remediationId,
});

// After (fixed)
const jobId = await this.jobManager.submitJob({
  localPath: cloneResult.path,
  options: { selectedEvaluators: parentEvaluatorIds },
  _cleanupFn: cloneResult.cleanup,
  _parentEvaluationId: remediation.evaluationId,
  _sourceRemediationId: remediationId,
});
```

## Critical Files

- **`src/api/routes/remediation.ts`** — where the fix is applied (~line 611 in `evaluateImpact`)
- `src/shared/evaluation/engine.ts` — shows the `if/else-if` priority logic (~line 680), no change needed here

## Verification

1. Run a remediation on any evaluation that has a "Conflicting AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md files" issue
2. After remediation completes, click "Evaluate Impact"
3. The new evaluation should reflect the post-patch state (AGENTS.md = merged content, CLAUDE.md = `@AGENTS.md`)
4. The "Conflicting files" issue should NOT appear in the new evaluation
5. Run `bun run test` to ensure existing tests still pass
