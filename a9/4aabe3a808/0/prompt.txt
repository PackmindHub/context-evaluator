Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Add Confirmation Modal Before Remediation Execution

## Context
When users click "Execute Remediation", the action starts immediately. Since remediation triggers AI provider calls (which cost money and modify files), a confirmation step helps prevent accidental execution. We'll add a modal that summarizes what will happen and asks the user to confirm.

## Changes

### File: `frontend/src/components/RemediateTab.tsx`

1. **Import the Modal component**
   - Add `import { Modal } from "./shared/Modal"` to existing imports

2. **Add confirmation modal state**
   - Add `const [showConfirmModal, setShowConfirmModal] = useState(false)` alongside other state declarations (~line 60)

3. **Change the "Execute Remediation" button handler**
   - Change `onClick={handleExecute}` (line 673) to `onClick={() => setShowConfirmModal(true)}`
   - The button label, disabled logic, and styling remain unchanged

4. **Add the confirmation modal JSX** (inside the config phase render, after the action buttons section around line 711)
   - Uses the existing `Modal` component (`frontend/src/components/shared/Modal.tsx`)
   - Modal content:
     - Summary: number of errors and suggestions selected
     - Target file type (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md)
     - Selected AI provider
     - Two buttons: "Cancel" (closes modal) and "Confirm" (closes modal + calls `handleExecute()`)

No new files, no new dependencies, no backend changes.

## Verification
- Run `bun run test` to check for regressions
- Run `bun run lint` to verify code style
- Manual: open the app, select issues, go to Remediate tab, click "Execute Remediation" — modal should appear with summary and confirm/cancel buttons
