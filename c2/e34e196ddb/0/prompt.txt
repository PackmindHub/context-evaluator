I think we should update the layout of the header bar containing a report summary. Currently in the headers, we have summary, errors, suggestions, remédiaire, debugging and cost analysis. I think we should add a little bit of color in errors and suggestion number. Currently, it's kind of gray. It's not very visible. And I think we should make it more visible. And same for Remediat. In the Remediat, I think we should use a kind of green color. So let me know if you have any questions.
