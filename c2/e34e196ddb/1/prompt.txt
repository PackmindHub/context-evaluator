Implement the following plan:

# Fix: Remediation deletion not available for failed remediations

## Context

When a remediation fails (status "failed"), the user gets stuck in a dead-end state:
- The UI stays in the **config phase** (no "Delete & Start Over" button — that only exists in the results phase)
- Attempting to execute a new remediation returns **409 "A remediation already exists for this evaluation"**
- The user has no way to clear the failed record

Root cause: the `loadExistingRemediation` effect only handles "completed" and "running"/"queued" statuses. The "failed" status falls through silently, staying in config phase without setting `remediationId` — making deletion impossible.

## Changes

**Single file**: `frontend/src/components/RemediateTab.tsx`

### 1. Handle "failed" status in the mount/restore effect (line ~156)

Add an `else if (data.status === "failed")` branch that:
- Sets `remediationId` to the failed record's ID (enabling the delete handler)
- Sets `executeError` with the failure message
- Stays in config phase (no phase change)

### 2. Add "Delete & Retry" button to the config phase error display (line ~848)

Replace the plain error text with a flex container that includes:
- The error message (existing)
- A "Delete & Retry" button (when `remediationId` is set and `!cloudMode`)
- Uses existing `handleDeleteRemediation` handler, which already resets all state

### 3. Fetch blocking remediation ID on 409 error during execution (line ~417)

In the `handleExecute` catch block, when the error message indicates "already exists":
- Call `api.getRemediationForEvaluation()` to fetch the blocking record's ID
- Set `remediationId` so the delete button becomes available

This handles the edge case where `loadExistingRemediation` didn't fire but a stale record blocks execution.

## Why no other changes needed

- **Backend**: `DELETE /api/remediation/:id` already works for failed remediations (only blocks queued/running)
- **State management**: Reuses existing `remediationId`, `executeError`, `isDeleting` state
- **Styles**: Uses existing `btn-secondary text-red-400 hover:text-red-300` pattern (same as results phase delete button)
- **No modal**: Failed remediations have nothing to lose, so inline button is sufficient (vs. confirmation modal for completed results)

## Verification

1. Start dev server: `bun run dev`
2. Run an evaluation, select issues, execute remediation, let it fail (or simulate via DB)
3. Verify the config phase shows error message with "Delete & Retry" button
4. Click "Delete & Retry" — verify the record is deleted and user can re-execute
5. Run `bun run test` and `bun run lint`
