    "intent": "Fix a bug where users couldn't delete failed remediations, getting stuck with a 409 conflict error when trying to start a new remediation. The UI needed to handle the 'failed' status and provide a 'Delete \u0026 Retry' button.",
    "outcome": "Successfully implemented a three-part fix in RemediateTab.tsx: (1) added 'failed' status handling in loadExistingRemediation to set remediationId and executeError, (2) added a 'Delete \u0026 Retry' button in the config phase error display, and (3) added 409 error handling to fetch the blocking remediation ID. All tests, lint, and typecheck passed.",
