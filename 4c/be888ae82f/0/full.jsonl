This persists across sessions.\n* **CLAUDE.md files**: Markdown files you write and maintain with instructions, rules, and preferences for Claude to follow.\n\nBoth are loaded into Claude's context at the start of every session, though auto memory loads only the first 200 lines of its main file.\n\n## Determine memory type\n\nClaude Code offers several memory locations in a hierarchical structure, each serving a different purpose:\n\n| Memory Type                | Location                                                                                                                                                        | Purpose                                             | Use Case Examples                                                    | Shared With                     |\n| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| **Managed policy**         | • macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md`<br />• Linux: `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`<br />• Windows: `C:\\Program Files\\ClaudeCode\\CLAUDE.md` | Organization-wide instructions managed by IT/DevOps | Company coding standards, security policies, compliance requirements | All users in organization       |\n| **Project memory**         | `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`                                                                                                                          | Team-shared instructions for the project            | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows             | Team members via source control |\n| **Project rules**          | `./.claude/rules/*.md`                                                                                                                                          | Modular, topic-specific project instructions        | Language-specific guidelines, testing conventions, API standards     | Team members via source control |\n| **User memory**            | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`                                                                                                                                           | Personal preferences for all projects               | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts                 | Just you (all projects)         |\n| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md`                                                                                                                                             | Personal project-specific preferences               | Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data                               | Just you (current project)      |\n| **Auto memory**            | `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`                                                                                                                          | Claude's automatic notes and learnings              | Project patterns, debugging insights, architecture notes             | Just you (per project)          |\n\nCLAUDE.md files in the directory hierarchy above the working directory are loaded in full at launch. CLAUDE.md files in child directories load on demand when Claude reads files in those directories. Auto memory loads only the first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md`. More specific instructions take precedence over broader ones.\n\n<Note>\n  CLAUDE.local.md files are automatically added to .gitignore, making them ideal for private project-specific preferences that shouldn't be checked into version control.\n</Note>\n\n## Auto memory\n\nAuto memory is a persistent directory where Claude records learnings, patterns, and insights as it works. Unlike CLAUDE.md files that contain instructions you write for Claude, auto memory contains notes Claude writes for itself based on what it discovers during sessions.\n\n<Note>\n  Auto memory is being rolled out gradually. If you aren't seeing auto memory, you can opt in by setting `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=0` in your environment.\n</Note>\n\n### What Claude remembers\n\nAs Claude works, it may save things like:\n\n* Project patterns: build commands, test conventions, code style preferences\n* Debugging insights: solutions to tricky problems, common error causes\n* Architecture notes: key files, module relationships, important abstractions\n* Your preferences: communication style, workflow habits, tool choices\n\n### Where auto memory is stored\n\nEach project gets its own memory directory at `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`. The `<project>` path is derived from the git repository root, so all subdirectories within the same repo share one auto memory directory. Git worktrees get separate memory directories. Outside a git repo, the working directory is used instead.\n\nThe directory contains a `MEMORY.md` entrypoint and optional topic files:\n\n```text  theme={null}\n~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/\n├── MEMORY.md          # Concise index, loaded into every session\n├── debugging.md       # Detailed notes on debugging patterns\n├── api-conventions.md # API design decisions\n└── ...                # Any other topic files Claude creates\n```\n\n`MEMORY.md` acts as an index of the memory directory. Claude reads and writes files in this directory throughout your session, using `MEMORY.md` to keep track of what's stored where.\n\n### How it works\n\n* The first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md` are loaded into Claude's system prompt at the start of every session. Content beyond 200 lines is not loaded automatically, and Claude is instructed to keep it concise by moving detailed notes into separate topic files.\n* Topic files like `debugging.md` or `patterns.md` are not loaded at startup. Claude reads them on demand using its standard file tools when it needs the information.\n* Claude reads and writes memory files during your session, so you'll see memory updates happen as you work.\n\n### Manage auto memory\n\nAuto memory files are markdown files you can edit at any time. Use `/memory` to open the file selector, which includes your auto memory entrypoint alongside your CLAUDE.md files.\n\nTo ask Claude to save something specific, tell it directly: \"remember that we use pnpm, not npm\" or \"save to memory that the API tests require a local Redis instance\".\n\nWhen neither variable is set, auto memory follows the gradual rollout. The variable name uses double-negative logic: `DISABLE=0` means \"don't disable\" and forces auto memory on.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nexport CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1  # Force off\nexport CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=0  # Force on\n```\n\n## CLAUDE.md imports\n\nCLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:\n\n```\nSee @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.\n\n# Additional Instructions\n- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md\n```\n\nBoth relative and absolute paths are allowed. Relative paths resolve relative to the file containing the import, not the working directory. For private per-project preferences that shouldn't be checked into version control, prefer `CLAUDE.local.md`: it is automatically loaded and added to `.gitignore`.\n\nIf you work across multiple git worktrees, `CLAUDE.local.md` only exists in one. Use a home-directory import instead so all worktrees share the same personal instructions:\n\n```\n# Individual Preferences\n- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  The first time Claude Code encounters external imports in a project, it shows an approval dialog listing the specific files. Approve to load them; decline to skip them. This is a one-time decision per project: once declined, the dialog does not resurface and the imports remain disabled.\n</Warning>\n\nTo avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.\n\n```\nThis code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`\n```\n\nImported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.\n\n## How Claude looks up memories\n\nClaude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to (but not including) the root directory */* and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in *foo/bar/*, and have memories in both *foo/CLAUDE.md* and *foo/bar/CLAUDE.md*.\n\nClaude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.\n\n### Load memory from additional directories\n\nThe `--add-dir` flag gives Claude access to additional directories outside your main working directory. By default, CLAUDE.md files from these directories are not loaded.\n\nTo also load memory files (CLAUDE.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md, and .claude/rules/\\*.md) from additional directories, set the `CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD` environment variable:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nCLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1 claude --add-dir ../shared-config\n```\n\n## Directly edit memories with `/memory`\n\nUse the `/memory` command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.\n\n## Set up project memory\n\nSuppose you want to set up a CLAUDE.md file to store important project information, conventions, and frequently used commands. Project memory can be stored in either `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`.\n\nBootstrap a CLAUDE.md for your codebase with the following command:\n\n```\n> /init\n```\n\n<Tip>\n  Tips:\n\n  * Include frequently used commands (build, test, lint) to avoid repeated searches\n  * Document code style preferences and naming conventions\n  * Add important architectural patterns specific to your project\n  * CLAUDE.md memories can be used for both instructions shared with your team and for your individual preferences.\n</Tip>\n\n## Modular rules with `.claude/rules/`\n\nFor larger projects, you can organize instructions into multiple files using the `.claude/rules/` directory. This allows teams to maintain focused, well-organized rule files instead of one large CLAUDE.md.\n\n### Basic structure\n\nPlace markdown files in your project's `.claude/rules/` directory:\n\n```\nyour-project/\n├── .claude/\n│   ├── CLAUDE.md           # Main project instructions\n│   └── rules/\n│       ├── code-style.md   # Code style guidelines\n│       ├── testing.md      # Testing conventions\n│       └── security.md     # Security requirements\n```\n\nAll `.md` files in `.claude/rules/` are automatically loaded as project memory, with the same priority as `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.\n\n### Path-specific rules\n\nRules can be scoped to specific files using YAML frontmatter with the `paths` field. These conditional rules only apply when Claude is working with files matching the specified patterns.\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n---\npaths:\n  - \"src/api/**/*.ts\"\n---\n\n# API Development Rules\n\n- All API endpoints must include input validation\n- Use the standard error response format\n- Include OpenAPI documentation comments\n```\n\nRules without a `paths` field are loaded unconditionally and apply to all files.\n\n### Glob patterns\n\nThe `paths` field supports standard glob patterns:\n\n| Pattern                | Matches                                  |\n| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| `**/*.ts`              | All TypeScript files in any directory    |\n| `src/**/*`             | All files under `src/` directory         |\n| `*.md`                 | Markdown files in the project root       |\n| `src/components/*.tsx` | React components in a specific directory |\n\nYou can specify multiple patterns:\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n---\npaths:\n  - \"src/**/*.ts\"\n  - \"lib/**/*.ts\"\n  - \"tests/**/*.test.ts\"\n---\n```\n\nBrace expansion is supported for matching multiple extensions or directories:\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n---\npaths:\n  - \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\"\n  - \"{src,lib}/**/*.ts\"\n---\n\n# TypeScript/React Rules\n```\n\nThis expands `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` to match both `.ts` and `.tsx` files.\n\n### Subdirectories\n\nRules can be organized into subdirectories for better structure:\n\n```\n.claude/rules/\n├── frontend/\n│   ├── react.md\n│   └── styles.md\n├── backend/\n│   ├── api.md\n│   └── database.md\n└── general.md\n```\n\nAll `.md` files are discovered recursively.\n\n### Symlinks\n\nThe `.claude/rules/` directory supports symlinks, allowing you to share common rules across multiple projects:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Symlink a shared rules directory\nln -s ~/shared-claude-rules .claude/rules/shared\n\n# Symlink individual rule files\nln -s ~/company-standards/security.md .claude/rules/security.md\n```\n\nSymlinks are resolved and their contents are loaded normally. Circular symlinks are detected and handled gracefully.\n\n### User-level rules\n\nYou can create personal rules that apply to all your projects in `~/.claude/rules/`:\n\n```\n~/.claude/rules/\n├── preferences.md    # Your personal coding preferences\n└── workflows.md      # Your preferred workflows\n```\n\nUser-level rules are loaded before project rules, giving project rules higher priority.\n\n<Tip>\n  Best practices for `.claude/rules/`:\n\n  * **Keep rules focused**: Each file should cover one topic (e.g., `testing.md`, `api-design.md`)\n  * **Use descriptive filenames**: The filename should indicate what the rules cover\n  * **Use conditional rules sparingly**: Only add `paths` frontmatter when rules truly apply to specific file types\n  * **Organize with subdirectories**: Group related rules (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`)\n</Tip>\n\n## Organization-level memory management\n\nOrganizations can deploy centrally managed CLAUDE.md files that apply to all users.\n\nTo set up organization-level memory management:\n\n1. Create the managed memory file at the **Managed policy** location shown in the [memory types table above](#determine-memory-type).\n\n2. Deploy via your configuration management system (MDM, Group Policy, Ansible, etc.) to ensure consistent distribution across all developer machines.\n\n## Memory best practices\n\n* **Be specific**: \"Use 2-space indentation\" is better than \"Format code properly\".\n* **Use structure to organize**: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.\n* **Review periodically**: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.\n"}]},"uuid":"912a80f0-533f-4a75-bb44-21eb16b1d86c","timestamp":"2026-02-17T16:00:21.773Z","toolUseResult":{"bytes":15373,"code":200,"codeText":"OK","result":"> ## Documentation Index\n> Fetch the complete documentation index at: https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt\n> Use this file to discover all available pages before exploring further.\n\n# Manage Claude's memory\n\n> Learn how to manage Claude Code's memory across sessions with different memory locations and best practices.\n\nClaude Code has two kinds of memory that persist across sessions:\n\n* **Auto memory**: Claude automatically saves useful context like project patterns, key commands, and your preferences. This persists across sessions.\n* **CLAUDE.md files**: Markdown files you write and maintain with instructions, rules, and preferences for Claude to follow.\n\nBoth are loaded into Claude's context at the start of every session, though auto memory loads only the first 200 lines of its main file.\n\n## Determine memory type\n\nClaude Code offers several memory locations in a hierarchical structure, each serving a different purpose:\n\n| Memory Type                | Location                                                                                                                                                        | Purpose                                             | Use Case Examples                                                    | Shared With                     |\n| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| **Managed policy**         | • macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md`<br />• Linux: `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`<br />• Windows: `C:\\Program Files\\ClaudeCode\\CLAUDE.md` | Organization-wide instructions managed by IT/DevOps | Company coding standards, security policies, compliance requirements | All users in organization       |\n| **Project memory**         | `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`                                                                                                                          | Team-shared instructions for the project            | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows             | Team members via source control |\n| **Project rules**          | `./.claude/rules/*.md`                                                                                                                                          | Modular, topic-specific project instructions        | Language-specific guidelines, testing conventions, API standards     | Team members via source control |\n| **User memory**            | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`                                                                                                                                           | Personal preferences for all projects               | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts                 | Just you (all projects)         |\n| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md`                                                                                                                                             | Personal project-specific preferences               | Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data                               | Just you (current project)      |\n| **Auto memory**            | `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`                                                                                                                          | Claude's automatic notes and learnings              | Project patterns, debugging insights, architecture notes             | Just you (per project)          |\n\nCLAUDE.md files in the directory hierarchy above the working directory are loaded in full at launch. CLAUDE.md files in child directories load on demand when Claude reads files in those directories. Auto memory loads only the first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md`. More specific instructions take precedence over broader ones.\n\n<Note>\n  CLAUDE.local.md files are automatically added to .gitignore, making them ideal for private project-specific preferences that shouldn't be checked into version control.\n</Note>\n\n## Auto memory\n\nAuto memory is a persistent directory where Claude records learnings, patterns, and insights as it works. Unlike CLAUDE.md files that contain instructions you write for Claude, auto memory contains notes Claude writes for itself based on what it discovers during sessions.\n\n<Note>\n  Auto memory is being rolled out gradually. If you aren't seeing auto memory, you can opt in by setting `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=0` in your environment.\n</Note>\n\n### What Claude remembers\n\nAs Claude works, it may save things like:\n\n* Project patterns: build commands, test conventions, code style preferences\n* Debugging insights: solutions to tricky problems, common error causes\n* Architecture notes: key files, module relationships, important abstractions\n* Your preferences: communication style, workflow habits, tool choices\n\n### Where auto memory is stored\n\nEach project gets its own memory directory at `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`. The `<project>` path is derived from the git repository root, so all subdirectories within the same repo share one auto memory directory. Git worktrees get separate memory directories. Outside a git repo, the working directory is used instead.\n\nThe directory contains a `MEMORY.md` entrypoint and optional topic files:\n\n```text  theme={null}\n~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/\n├── MEMORY.md          # Concise index, loaded into every session\n├── debugging.md       # Detailed notes on debugging patterns\n├── api-conventions.md # API design decisions\n└── ...                # Any other topic files Claude creates\n```\n\n`MEMORY.md` acts as an index of the memory directory. Claude reads and writes files in this directory throughout your session, using `MEMORY.md` to keep track of what's stored where.\n\n### How it works\n\n* The first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md` are loaded into Claude's system prompt at the start of every session. Content beyond 200 lines is not loaded automatically, and Claude is instructed to keep it concise by moving detailed notes into separate topic files.\n* Topic files like `debugging.md` or `patterns.md` are not loaded at startup. Claude reads them on demand using its standard file tools when it needs the information.\n* Claude reads and writes memory files during your session, so you'll see memory updates happen as you work.\n\n### Manage auto memory\n\nAuto memory files are markdown files you can edit at any time. Use `/memory` to open the file selector, which includes your auto memory entrypoint alongside your CLAUDE.md files.\n\nTo ask Claude to save something specific, tell it directly: \"remember that we use pnpm, not npm\" or \"save to memory that the API tests require a local Redis instance\".\n\nWhen neither variable is set, auto memory follows the gradual rollout. The variable name uses double-negative logic: `DISABLE=0` means \"don't disable\" and forces auto memory on.\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nexport CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1  # Force off\nexport CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=0  # Force on\n```\n\n## CLAUDE.md imports\n\nCLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:\n\n```\nSee @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.\n\n# Additional Instructions\n- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md\n```\n\nBoth relative and absolute paths are allowed. Relative paths resolve relative to the file containing the import, not the working directory. For private per-project preferences that shouldn't be checked into version control, prefer `CLAUDE.local.md`: it is automatically loaded and added to `.gitignore`.\n\nIf you work across multiple git worktrees, `CLAUDE.local.md` only exists in one. Use a home-directory import instead so all worktrees share the same personal instructions:\n\n```\n# Individual Preferences\n- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md\n```\n\n<Warning>\n  The first time Claude Code encounters external imports in a project, it shows an approval dialog listing the specific files. Approve to load them; decline to skip them. This is a one-time decision per project: once declined, the dialog does not resurface and the imports remain disabled.\n</Warning>\n\nTo avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.\n\n```\nThis code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`\n```\n\nImported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.\n\n## How Claude looks up memories\n\nClaude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to (but not including) the root directory */* and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in *foo/bar/*, and have memories in both *foo/CLAUDE.md* and *foo/bar/CLAUDE.md*.\n\nClaude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.\n\n### Load memory from additional directories\n\nThe `--add-dir` flag gives Claude access to additional directories outside your main working directory. By default, CLAUDE.md files from these directories are not loaded.\n\nTo also load memory files (CLAUDE.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md, and .claude/rules/\\*.md) from additional directories, set the `CLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD` environment variable:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\nCLAUDE_CODE_ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES_CLAUDE_MD=1 claude --add-dir ../shared-config\n```\n\n## Directly edit memories with `/memory`\n\nUse the `/memory` command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.\n\n## Set up project memory\n\nSuppose you want to set up a CLAUDE.md file to store important project information, conventions, and frequently used commands. Project memory can be stored in either `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`.\n\nBootstrap a CLAUDE.md for your codebase with the following command:\n\n```\n> /init\n```\n\n<Tip>\n  Tips:\n\n  * Include frequently used commands (build, test, lint) to avoid repeated searches\n  * Document code style preferences and naming conventions\n  * Add important architectural patterns specific to your project\n  * CLAUDE.md memories can be used for both instructions shared with your team and for your individual preferences.\n</Tip>\n\n## Modular rules with `.claude/rules/`\n\nFor larger projects, you can organize instructions into multiple files using the `.claude/rules/` directory. This allows teams to maintain focused, well-organized rule files instead of one large CLAUDE.md.\n\n### Basic structure\n\nPlace markdown files in your project's `.claude/rules/` directory:\n\n```\nyour-project/\n├── .claude/\n│   ├── CLAUDE.md           # Main project instructions\n│   └── rules/\n│       ├── code-style.md   # Code style guidelines\n│       ├── testing.md      # Testing conventions\n│       └── security.md     # Security requirements\n```\n\nAll `.md` files in `.claude/rules/` are automatically loaded as project memory, with the same priority as `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.\n\n### Path-specific rules\n\nRules can be scoped to specific files using YAML frontmatter with the `paths` field. These conditional rules only apply when Claude is working with files matching the specified patterns.\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n---\npaths:\n  - \"src/api/**/*.ts\"\n---\n\n# API Development Rules\n\n- All API endpoints must include input validation\n- Use the standard error response format\n- Include OpenAPI documentation comments\n```\n\nRules without a `paths` field are loaded unconditionally and apply to all files.\n\n### Glob patterns\n\nThe `paths` field supports standard glob patterns:\n\n| Pattern                | Matches                                  |\n| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| `**/*.ts`              | All TypeScript files in any directory    |\n| `src/**/*`             | All files under `src/` directory         |\n| `*.md`                 | Markdown files in the project root       |\n| `src/components/*.tsx` | React components in a specific directory |\n\nYou can specify multiple patterns:\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n---\npaths:\n  - \"src/**/*.ts\"\n  - \"lib/**/*.ts\"\n  - \"tests/**/*.test.ts\"\n---\n```\n\nBrace expansion is supported for matching multiple extensions or directories:\n\n```markdown  theme={null}\n---\npaths:\n  - \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\"\n  - \"{src,lib}/**/*.ts\"\n---\n\n# TypeScript/React Rules\n```\n\nThis expands `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` to match both `.ts` and `.tsx` files.\n\n### Subdirectories\n\nRules can be organized into subdirectories for better structure:\n\n```\n.claude/rules/\n├── frontend/\n│   ├── react.md\n│   └── styles.md\n├── backend/\n│   ├── api.md\n│   └── database.md\n└── general.md\n```\n\nAll `.md` files are discovered recursively.\n\n### Symlinks\n\nThe `.claude/rules/` directory supports symlinks, allowing you to share common rules across multiple projects:\n\n```bash  theme={null}\n# Symlink a shared rules directory\nln -s ~/shared-claude-rules .claude/rules/shared\n\n# Symlink individual rule files\nln -s ~/company-standards/security.md .claude/rules/security.md\n```\n\nSymlinks are resolved and their contents are loaded normally. Circular symlinks are detected and handled gracefully.\n\n### User-level rules\n\nYou can create personal rules that apply to all your projects in `~/.claude/rules/`:\n\n```\n~/.claude/rules/\n├── preferences.md    # Your personal coding preferences\n└── workflows.md      # Your preferred workflows\n```\n\nUser-level rules are loaded before project rules, giving project rules higher priority.\n\n<Tip>\n  Best practices for `.claude/rules/`:\n\n  * **Keep rules focused**: Each file should cover one topic (e.g., `testing.md`, `api-design.md`)\n  * **Use descriptive filenames**: The filename should indicate what the rules cover\n  * **Use conditional rules sparingly**: Only add `paths` frontmatter when rules truly apply to specific file types\n  * **Organize with subdirectories**: Group related rules (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`)\n</Tip>\n\n## Organization-level memory management\n\nOrganizations can deploy centrally managed CLAUDE.md files that apply to all users.\n\nTo set up organization-level memory management:\n\n1. Create the managed memory file at the **Managed policy** location shown in the [memory types table above](#determine-memory-type).\n\n2. Deploy via your configuration management system (MDM, Group Policy, Ansible, etc.) to ensure consistent distribution across all developer machines.\n\n## Memory best practices\n\n* **Be specific**: \"Use 2-space indentation\" is better than \"Format code properly\".\n* **Use structure to organize**: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.\n* **Review periodically**: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.\n","durationMs":246,"url":"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory"},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"6e66b997-9853-44bd-ac9c-a9c609d94a7d"}

The current template uses `alwaysApply: true` in the frontmatter, but Claude Code rules also support a `paths` field with glob patterns for path-specific rules. The user wants me to update the Claude Code section to show how to use glob patterns.\n\nLooking at the docs:\n- Rules can have `paths` field in YAML frontmatter with glob patterns\n- Rules without `paths` are loaded unconditionally\n- When `paths` is specified, rules only apply when Claude works with matching files\n\nThe current example uses `alwaysApply: true`. I need to update it to show how globs work, with a `paths` field instead of (or in addition to) `alwaysApply`.\n\n\nI'm reviewing the current Claude Code section to see what needs updating. I should show both the universal rule approach with `alwaysApply: true` and the path-scoped approach with glob patterns, making it clear how each option works and when to use them. I need to show how to actually use glob patterns in the `paths` field rather than relying on `alwaysApply`. The cleanest approach is to replace the current example with one that demonstrates `paths` with glob patterns, making it clear that rules without `paths` apply universally while scoped rules target specific file patterns.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5182,"cache_read_input_tokens":31971,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":5182},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYDvK8zGbaLL64wanFknm","type":"assistant","uuid":"a8c26c84-ed52-4406-a57c-654feff58dc5","timestamp":"2026-02-17T16:00:46.534Z"}

Defines constraints and conventions the agent must follow at all times.\n\n**Skill** — A folder with instructions, scripts, and resources loaded on-demand via progressive disclosure. Provides procedural knowledge activated when a task matches its description.\n\n### Decision Criteria\n\nAsk these four questions to decide whether a remediation should produce a standard or a skill:\n\n1. **Must the agent always know this?** If yes → standard. If it is only relevant during a specific task → skill.\n2. **Is it a constraint or a capability?** Constraints and guardrails → standard. Capabilities and workflows → skill.\n3. **Does it need bundled resources?** If it requires scripts, templates, or assets → skill. If a single file of rules suffices → standard.\n4. **Is it short and declarative?** Bullet-point rules → standard. Procedural paragraphs with sequenced steps → skill.\n\n### Boundary Rule\n\nExtract **rules** into a standard and **procedures** into a skill. A single remediation topic can produce both. When in doubt, prefer a standard.\n\n## Standard Creation\n\n### Generic Rules\n\n- Standards must contain a one sentence-summary describing the purpose of the rules, their intent, their rationale, as a short introduction.\n- Rules must be a list of bullet-points rules, starting with a verb.\n- Use scoped glob patterns when relevant based on the suggestions.\n\n### Claude Code\n\nCreate file at `.claude/rules/<standard-slug>.md`:\n\n```md\n---\nname: Domain Events\nalwaysApply: true\ndescription: Use when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners.\n---\n\n## Standard: Domain Events\n\nUse when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners. :\n\n- Define event classes in `packages/types/src/{domain}/events/` with an `index.ts` barrel file\n- Define payload as a separate `{EventName}Payload` interface\n- Extend `PackmindListener<TAdapter>` and implement `registerHandlers()` to subscribe to events\n- Extend `UserEvent` for user-triggered actions, `SystemEvent` for background/automated processes\n- Include `userId` and `organizationId` in UserEvent payloads; include `organizationId` in SystemEvent payloads when applicable\n- Suffix event class names with `Event` (e.g., `StandardUpdatedEvent`)\n- Use `eventEmitterService.emit(new MyEvent(payload))` to emit events\n- Use `static override readonly eventName` with `domain.entity.action` pattern\n- Use `this.subscribe(EventClass, this.handlerMethod)` to register handlers\n- Use arrow functions for handlers to preserve `this` binding\n```\n\n### AGENTS.md\n\nAppend a section specific to the coding standards and guidelines in AGENTS.md, at the location where it is most relevant:\n\n```md\n## Standard: Testing good practices\n\nStandardize unit test structure and naming in TypeScript/TSX test files using verb-first descriptions, Arrange-Act-Assert flow without comments, nested describe('when...') context blocks, and single-expect test cases to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging. :\n* Follow  'Arrange, Act, Assert' pattern\n* Move 'when' contextual clauses from `it()` into nested `describe('when...')` blocks\n* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels\n* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should'\n* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach\n```\n\n### GitHub Copilot\n\nCreate file at `.github/instructions/<standard-slug>.md`:\n\n```md\n---\napplyTo: '**/*.ts'\n---\n## Standard: Typescript code standards\n\nAdopt TypeScript code standards by prefixing interfaces with \"I\" and abstract classes with \"Abstract\" while choosing \"Type\" for plain objects and \"Interface\" for implementations to enhance clarity and maintainability when writing .ts files. :\n* Prefix abstract classes with Abstract\n* Prefix interfaces with I\n* Use Type for plain objects, Interface when implementation is required\n```\n\n## Skill Creation\n\nSkill placement varies by target agent:\n- **AGENTS.md**: `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`\n- **Claude Code**: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`\n- **GitHub Copilot**: `.github/skills/<skill-name>/`\n\nFor skill creation, follow the complete process in [packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md](packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md).\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":31,"oldLines":13,"newStart":31,"newLines":33,"lines":[" "," ### Claude Code"," ","-Create file at `.claude/rules/<standard-slug>.md`:","+Create file at `.claude/rules/<standard-slug>.md`."," ","+**Frontmatter options** — use one of two scoping modes:","+","+- **Always apply** (`alwaysApply: true`): Rule is loaded unconditionally into every session.","+- **Path-scoped** (`paths: [...]`): Rule is loaded only when Claude works with files matching the glob patterns.","+","+When the suggestions target specific file types or directories, prefer `paths` with glob patterns.

Keep concise, under 5k words.>\n```\n\n## Progressive Disclosure\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** — Always in context (~100 words). Determines when the skill activates.\n2. **SKILL.md body** — Loaded when skill triggers (<5k words).\n\n## Metadata Quality\n\nThe `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when the agent activates the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use third-person voice (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n## Writing Style\n\nWrite the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\").\n\n## Creation Steps\n\n1. **Understand usage** — Identify concrete examples of how the skill will be used. Clarify functionality, usage patterns, and triggers.\n2. **Write SKILL.md** — Answer: What is the purpose? When should it activate? What are the step-by-step instructions? Focus on procedural knowledge that would be beneficial and non-obvious to another agent instance.\n3. **Iterate** — Test the skill on real tasks, notice struggles or inefficiencies, and refine the instructions.\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":247,"cache_read_input_tokens":53413,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":247},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYDvjopHyLsukm8cSXsXc","type":"assistant","uuid":"00604067-d23b-4ba6-934a-496cb0793403","timestamp":"2026-02-17T16:06:17.352Z"}

When the rules are universal constraints, use `alwaysApply: true`.\n\nSupported glob patterns:\n\n| Pattern                | Matches                                  |\n| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| `**/*.ts`              | All TypeScript files in any directory    |\n| `src/**/*`             | All files under `src/` directory         |\n| `*.md`                 | Markdown files in the project root       |\n| `src/components/*.tsx` | React components in a specific directory |\n| `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`    | TypeScript and TSX files under `src/`    |\n| `{src,lib}/**/*.ts`    | TypeScript files under `src/` or `lib/`  |\n\n#### Example with path-scoped globs\n\n```md\n---\npaths:\n  - \"src/domain/**/events/**/*.ts\"\n  - \"src/listeners/**/*.ts\"\n---\n\n## Standard: Domain Events\n\nUse when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners. :\n\n- Define event classes in `packages/types/src/{domain}/events/` with an `index.ts` barrel file\n- Define payload as a separate `{EventName}Payload` interface\n- Extend `PackmindListener<TAdapter>` and implement `registerHandlers()` to subscribe to events\n- Extend `UserEvent` for user-triggered actions, `SystemEvent` for background/automated processes\n- Include `userId` and `organizationId` in UserEvent payloads; include `organizationId` in SystemEvent payloads when applicable\n- Suffix event class names with `Event` (e.g., `StandardUpdatedEvent`)\n- Use `eventEmitterService.emit(new MyEvent(payload))` to emit events\n- Use `static override readonly eventName` with `domain.entity.action` pattern\n- Use `this.subscribe(EventClass, this.handlerMethod)` to register handlers\n- Use arrow functions for handlers to preserve `this` binding\n```\n\n#### Example with alwaysApply\n\n```md\n---\nalwaysApply: true\n---\n\n## Standard: Git Commit Conventions\n\nWrite clear, conventional commit messages for consistent repository history. :\n\n- Use conventional commit prefixes: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore\n- Write imperative mood in subject line (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n- Limit subject line to 72 characters\n```\n\n### AGENTS.md\n\nAppend a section specific to the coding standards and guidelines in AGENTS.md, at the location where it is most relevant:\n\n```md\n## Standard: Testing good practices\n\nStandardize unit test structure and naming in TypeScript/TSX test files using verb-first descriptions, Arrange-Act-Assert flow without comments, nested describe('when...') context blocks, and single-expect test cases to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging. :\n* Follow  'Arrange, Act, Assert' pattern\n* Move 'when' contextual clauses from `it()` into nested `describe('when...')` blocks\n* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels\n* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should'\n* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach\n```\n\n### GitHub Copilot\n\nCreate file at `.github/instructions/<standard-slug>.md`:\n\n```md\n---\napplyTo: '**/*.ts'\n---\n## Standard: Typescript code standards\n\nAdopt TypeScript code standards by prefixing interfaces with \"I\" and abstract classes with \"Abstract\" while choosing \"Type\" for plain objects and \"Interface\" for implementations to enhance clarity and maintainability when writing .ts files. :\n* Prefix abstract classes with Abstract\n* Prefix interfaces with I\n* Use Type for plain objects, Interface when implementation is required\n```\n\n## Skill Creation\n\nSkill placement varies by target agent:\n- **AGENTS.md**: `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`\n- **Claude Code**: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`\n- **GitHub Copilot**: `.github/skills/<skill-name>/`\n\nFor skill creation, follow the complete process in [packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md](packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md).\n","numLines":134,"startLine":1,"totalLines":134}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"09f8e5e7-51e5-45eb-98db-fd31d53abdb4"}

Defines constraints and conventions the agent must follow at all times.\n\n**Skill** — A folder with a SKILL.md file loaded on-demand via progressive disclosure. Provides procedural knowledge activated when a task matches its description.\n\n### Decision Criteria\n\nAsk these three questions to decide whether a remediation should produce a standard or a skill:\n\n1. **Must the agent always know this?** If yes → standard. If it is only relevant during a specific task → skill.\n2. **Is it a constraint or a capability?** Constraints and guardrails → standard. Capabilities and workflows → skill.\n3. **Is it short and declarative?** Bullet-point rules → standard. Procedural paragraphs with sequenced steps → skill.\n\n### Boundary Rule\n\nExtract **rules** into a standard and **procedures** into a skill. A single remediation topic can produce both. When in doubt, prefer a standard.\n\n## Standard Creation\n\n### Generic Rules\n\n- Standards must contain a one sentence-summary describing the purpose of the rules, their intent, their rationale, as a short introduction.\n- Rules must be a list of bullet-points rules, starting with a verb.\n- Use scoped glob patterns when relevant based on the suggestions.\n\n### Claude Code\n\nCreate file at `.claude/rules/<standard-slug>.md`.\n\n**Frontmatter options** — use one of two scoping modes:\n\n- **Always apply** (`alwaysApply: true`): Rule is loaded unconditionally into every session.\n- **Path-scoped** (`paths: [...]`): Rule is loaded only when Claude works with files matching the glob patterns.\n\nWhen the suggestions target specific file types or directories, prefer `paths` with glob patterns. When the rules are universal constraints, use `alwaysApply: true`.\n\nSupported glob patterns:\n\n| Pattern                | Matches                                  |\n| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| `**/*.ts`              | All TypeScript files in any directory    |\n| `src/**/*`             | All files under `src/` directory         |\n| `*.md`                 | Markdown files in the project root       |\n| `src/components/*.tsx` | React components in a specific directory |\n| `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}`    | TypeScript and TSX files under `src/`    |\n| `{src,lib}/**/*.ts`    | TypeScript files under `src/` or `lib/`  |\n\n#### Example with path-scoped globs\n\n```md\n---\npaths:\n  - \"src/domain/**/events/**/*.ts\"\n  - \"src/listeners/**/*.ts\"\n---\n\n## Standard: Domain Events\n\nUse when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners. :\n\n- Define event classes in `packages/types/src/{domain}/events/` with an `index.ts` barrel file\n- Define payload as a separate `{EventName}Payload` interface\n- Extend `PackmindListener<TAdapter>` and implement `registerHandlers()` to subscribe to events\n- Extend `UserEvent` for user-triggered actions, `SystemEvent` for background/automated processes\n- Include `userId` and `organizationId` in UserEvent payloads; include `organizationId` in SystemEvent payloads when applicable\n- Suffix event class names with `Event` (e.g., `StandardUpdatedEvent`)\n- Use `eventEmitterService.emit(new MyEvent(payload))` to emit events\n- Use `static override readonly eventName` with `domain.entity.action` pattern\n- Use `this.subscribe(EventClass, this.handlerMethod)` to register handlers\n- Use arrow functions for handlers to preserve `this` binding\n```\n\n#### Example with alwaysApply\n\n```md\n---\nalwaysApply: true\n---\n\n## Standard: Git Commit Conventions\n\nWrite clear, conventional commit messages for consistent repository history. :\n\n- Use conventional commit prefixes: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore\n- Write imperative mood in subject line (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n- Limit subject line to 72 characters\n```\n\n### AGENTS.md\n\nAppend a section specific to the coding standards and guidelines in AGENTS.md, at the location where it is most relevant:\n\n```md\n## Standard: Testing good practices\n\nStandardize unit test structure and naming in TypeScript/TSX test files using verb-first descriptions, Arrange-Act-Assert flow without comments, nested describe('when...') context blocks, and single-expect test cases to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging. :\n* Follow  'Arrange, Act, Assert' pattern\n* Move 'when' contextual clauses from `it()` into nested `describe('when...')` blocks\n* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels\n* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should'\n* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach\n```\n\n### GitHub Copilot\n\nCreate file at `.github/instructions/<standard-slug>.md`:\n\n```md\n---\napplyTo: '**/*.ts'\n---\n## Standard: Typescript code standards\n\nAdopt TypeScript code standards by prefixing interfaces with \"I\" and abstract classes with \"Abstract\" while choosing \"Type\" for plain objects and \"Interface\" for implementations to enhance clarity and maintainability when writing .ts files. :\n* Prefix abstract classes with Abstract\n* Prefix interfaces with I\n* Use Type for plain objects, Interface when implementation is required\n```\n\n## Skill Creation\n\nSkill placement varies by target agent:\n- **AGENTS.md**: `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`\n- **Claude Code**: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`\n- **GitHub Copilot**: `.github/skills/<skill-name>/`\n\nFor skill creation, follow the complete process in [packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md](packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md).\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":6,"oldLines":7,"newStart":6,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," **Standard** — A short, declarative rule file always loaded into context.

Determines when the skill activates.\n2. **SKILL.md body** — Loaded when skill triggers (<5k words).\n\n## Metadata Quality\n\nThe `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when the agent activates the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use third-person voice (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n## Writing Style\n\nWrite the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\").\n\n## Creation Steps\n\n1. **Understand usage** — Identify concrete examples of how the skill will be used. Clarify functionality, usage patterns, and triggers.\n2. **Write SKILL.md** — Answer: What is the purpose? When should it activate? What are the step-by-step instructions? Focus on procedural knowledge that would be beneficial and non-obvious to another agent instance.\n3. **Iterate** — Test the skill on real tasks, notice struggles or inefficiencies, and refine the instructions.\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":10,"oldLines":7,"newStart":10,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ## Skill Structure"," ","-A skill is a single `SKILL.md` file inside a named folder:","+A skill is a single `SKILL.md` file inside a named folder.
