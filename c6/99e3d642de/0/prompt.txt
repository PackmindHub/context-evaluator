Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Increase Visibility of Standards/Skills Counts in Remediation Plan

## Context
The bottom sections of the remediation plan (both the persistent "What's next" section and per-remediation banners) show standards and skills counts in small text that blends in. The user wants these numbers to be more prominent and visible.

## Changes

### 1. RemediateTab.tsx (persistent bottom section, ~line 559-568)

**Current**: The count text uses `text-body text-slate-300` with a `font-semibold text-slate-100` span — same size as surrounding body text.

**Change**: Make the artifact count line larger and more prominent:
- Increase text size from `text-body` (0.875rem) to `text-base` (1rem) for the count line
- Style the numbers with `text-sm font-bold text-blue-400` badge-like appearance using an inline highlight background (`bg-blue-500/15 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded`)
- This makes the "3 standards & 2 skills" pop visually against the muted surrounding text

### 2. RemediationHistoryCard.tsx (per-remediation banner, ~line 343-348)

**Current**: Uses `text-xs text-slate-400` for the entire sentence including the counts — very small and muted.

**Change**:
- Increase the count sentence from `text-xs` to `text-sm`
- Wrap the `formatArtifactCount()` output in a highlighted span with `font-bold text-blue-400`

### Files to modify
- `frontend/src/components/RemediateTab.tsx` (~line 560-567)
- `frontend/src/components/RemediationHistoryCard.tsx` (~line 343-345)

## Verification
- `bun run test`
- `bun run lint`
- Visual check: `bun run dev` → navigate to Remediate tab → verify counts are larger and highlighted
