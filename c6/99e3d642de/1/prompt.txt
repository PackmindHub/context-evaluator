Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Add nesting guidance to skill Instructions template

## Context

Generated SKILL.md files have flat bullet lists in the `## Instructions` section, even when steps logically contain sub-steps (e.g., "Expect script X to:" followed by its behaviors). The AI has no guidance to use indented sub-bullets, so it defaults to flat lists. This hurts readability.

## Changes

### 1. Update skill creation prompt template
**File**: `prompts/context-remediation/packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md` (line 38)

Replace the placeholder:
```
<Step-by-step procedural instructions written in imperative/infinitive form (verb-first, not second person). Keep concise, under 5k words.>
```
With something like:
```
<Step-by-step procedural instructions written in imperative/infinitive form (verb-first, not second person). Use indented sub-bullets when a step has sub-steps, expected behaviors, or details. Keep concise, under 5k words.>
```

### 2. Update prompt-generator.ts template
**File**: `src/shared/remediation/prompt-generator.ts` (line 458, inside `getSkillInstructions()`)

Apply the same change to the inline template string.

## Verification

- Run `bun run test` to ensure no regressions
- Run `bun run lint` to ensure formatting is clean
