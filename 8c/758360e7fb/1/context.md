Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Enable Remediation in Cloud Mode + One-Per-Evaluation + Deletion

## Context

Remediation is currently skipped in cloud mode (selections and remediation persistence are bypassed). The goal is to:
1. **Enable remediation in cloud mode** — one-and-done (no delete, no re-run)
2. **Enforce one remediation per evaluation** (both modes)
3. **Allow deletion in non-cloud mode** — users can delete a remediation and re-run with fresh git state
