Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n    45→\n    46→#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n    47→\n    48→##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n    49→\n    50→Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n    51→\n    52→- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n    53→- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n    54→- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n    55→- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n    56→\n    57→##### References (`references/`)\n    58→\n    59→Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n    60→\n    61→- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n    62→- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n    63→- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n    64→- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n    65→- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n    66→- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n    67→\n    68→##### Assets (`assets/`)\n    69→\n    70→Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n    71→\n    72→- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n    73→- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n    74→- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n    75→- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n    76→\n    77→### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n    78→\n    79→Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n    80→\n    81→1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n    82→2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n    83→3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited\\*)\n    84→\n    85→\\*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n    86→\n    87→## Prerequisites\n    88→\n    89→Before running any skill scripts, verify that the required tools are available:\n    90→\n    91→### Python 3\n    92→\n    93→Check if Python 3 is installed:\n    94→\n    95→```bash\n    96→python3 --version\n    97→```\n    98→\n    99→If not available, install it:\n   100→\n   101→- **macOS**: `brew install python3`\n   102→- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install python3`\n   103→- **Windows**: Download from https://python.org or use `winget install Python.Python.3`\n   104→\n   105→### Packmind CLI\n   106→\n   107→Check if packmind-cli is installed:\n   108→\n   109→```bash\n   110→packmind-cli --version\n   111→```\n   112→\n   113→If not available, install it:\n   114→\n   115→```bash\n   116→npm install -g packmind-cli\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→## Skill Creation Process\n   120→\n   121→To create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n   122→\n   123→### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n   124→\n   125→Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n   126→\n   127→To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n   128→\n   129→For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n   130→\n   131→- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n   132→- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n   133→- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n   134→- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n   135→\n   136→To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n   137→\n   138→Conclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n   139→\n   140→### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n   141→\n   142→To turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n   143→\n   144→1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n   145→2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n   146→\n   147→Example: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n   148→\n   149→1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n   150→2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n   151→\n   152→Example: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n   153→\n   154→1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n   155→2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n   156→\n   157→Example: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n   158→\n   159→1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n   160→2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n   161→\n   162→To establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n   163→\n   164→### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n   165→\n   166→At this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n   167→\n   168→Skip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n   169→\n   170→**Before running the script**, verify that python3 and packmind-cli are available (see Prerequisites section). If not installed, install them first.\n   171→\n   172→When creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n   173→\n   174→Usage:\n   175→\n   176→```bash\n   177→python3 scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n   178→```\n   179→\n   180→The script:\n   181→\n   182→- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n   183→- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n   184→- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n   185→- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n   186→\n   187→After initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n   188→\n   189→### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n   190→\n   191→When editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n   192→\n   193→#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n   194→\n   195→To begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n   196→\n   197→Also, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n   198→\n   199→#### Update SKILL.md\n   200→\n   201→**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n   202→\n   203→To complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n   204→\n   205→1.

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.\"\nlicense: 'Complete terms in LICENSE.txt'\n---\n\n# Create skill\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited\\*)\n\n\\*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore running any skill scripts, verify that the required tools are available:\n\n### Python 3\n\nCheck if Python 3 is installed:\n\n```bash\npython3 --version\n```\n\nIf not available, install it:\n\n- **macOS**: `brew install python3`\n- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install python3`\n- **Windows**: Download from https://python.org or use `winget install Python.Python.3`\n\n### Packmind CLI\n\nCheck if packmind-cli is installed:\n\n```bash\npackmind-cli --version\n```\n\nIf not available, install it:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g packmind-cli\n```\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\n**Before running the script**, verify that python3 and packmind-cli are available (see Prerequisites section). If not installed, install them first.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\npython3 scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n\nTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n2. When should the skill be used?\n3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n### Step 5: Validating a Skill\n\nBefore distributing, validate the skill to ensure it meets all requirements.\n\n**Before running the script**, verify that python3 is available (see Prerequisites section). If not installed, install it first.\n\n```bash\npython3 scripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nThe validation script checks:\n\n- YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n- Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n- Description completeness and quality\n\nIf validation fails, fix the reported errors and run the validation again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n\n### Step 7: Distributing a Skill\n\n**After successful validation, always run the distribution command** to register the skill with Packmind. Do not skip this step.\n\n**Before running the command**, verify that packmind-cli is available (see Prerequisites section). If not installed, install it first.\n\nRun the following command with the actual skill path:\n\n```bash\npackmind-cli skills add <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nThis registers the skill with Packmind, making it available for deployment to target repositories and AI coding agents.\n\n### Step 8: Offer to Add to Package\n\nAfter successful distribution, check if the skill fits an existing package:\n\n1. Run `packmind-cli install --list` to get available packages\n2. If no packages exist, skip this step silently and end the workflow\n3. Analyze the created skill's name and description against each package's name and description\n4. If a package is a clear semantic fit (the skill's domain/technology aligns with the package's purpose):\n   - Present to user: \"This skill seems to fit the `<package-slug>` package.\"\n   - Offer three options:\n     - Add to `<package-slug>`\n     - Choose a different package\n     - Skip\n5. If no clear fit is found, skip silently (do not mention packages)\n6. If user chooses to add:\n   - Run: `packmind-cli packages add --to <package-slug> --skill <skill-slug>`\n   - Ask: \"Would you like me to run `packmind-cli install` to sync the changes?\"\n   - If yes, run: `packmind-cli install`\n","numLines":270,"startLine":1,"totalLines":270}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"05627e9f-e3e1-41f4-836c-4ecd658f2084"}

Defines constraints and conventions the agent must follow at all times.\n\n**Skill** — A folder with instructions, scripts, and resources loaded on-demand via progressive disclosure. Provides procedural knowledge activated when a task matches its description.\n\n### Decision Criteria\n\nAsk these four questions to decide whether a remediation should produce a standard or a skill:\n\n1. **Must the agent always know this?** If yes → standard. If it is only relevant during a specific task → skill.\n2. **Is it a constraint or a capability?** Constraints and guardrails → standard. Capabilities and workflows → skill.\n3. **Does it need bundled resources?** If it requires scripts, templates, or assets → skill. If a single file of rules suffices → standard.\n4. **Is it short and declarative?** Bullet-point rules → standard. Procedural paragraphs with sequenced steps → skill.\n\n### Boundary Rule\n\nExtract **rules** into a standard and **procedures** into a skill. A single remediation topic can produce both. When in doubt, prefer a standard.\n\n## Standard Creation\n\n### Generic Rules\n\n- Standards must contain a one sentence-summary describing the purpose of the rules, their intent, their rationale, as a short introduction.\n- Rules must be a list of bullet-points rules, starting with a verb.\n- Use scoped glob patterns when relevant based on the suggestions.\n\n### Claude Code\n\nCreate file at `.claude/rules/<standard-slug>.md`:\n\n```md\n---\nname: Domain Events\nalwaysApply: true\ndescription: Use when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners.\n---\n\n## Standard: Domain Events\n\nUse when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners. :\n\n- Define event classes in `packages/types/src/{domain}/events/` with an `index.ts` barrel file\n- Define payload as a separate `{EventName}Payload` interface\n- Extend `PackmindListener<TAdapter>` and implement `registerHandlers()` to subscribe to events\n- Extend `UserEvent` for user-triggered actions, `SystemEvent` for background/automated processes\n- Include `userId` and `organizationId` in UserEvent payloads; include `organizationId` in SystemEvent payloads when applicable\n- Suffix event class names with `Event` (e.g., `StandardUpdatedEvent`)\n- Use `eventEmitterService.emit(new MyEvent(payload))` to emit events\n- Use `static override readonly eventName` with `domain.entity.action` pattern\n- Use `this.subscribe(EventClass, this.handlerMethod)` to register handlers\n- Use arrow functions for handlers to preserve `this` binding\n```\n\n### AGENTS.md\n\nAppend a section specific to the coding standards and guidelines in AGENTS.md, at the location where it is most relevant:\n\n```md\n## Standard: Testing good practices\n\nStandardize unit test structure and naming in TypeScript/TSX test files using verb-first descriptions, Arrange-Act-Assert flow without comments, nested describe('when...') context blocks, and single-expect test cases to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging. :\n* Follow  'Arrange, Act, Assert' pattern\n* Move 'when' contextual clauses from `it()` into nested `describe('when...')` blocks\n* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels\n* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should'\n* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach\n```\n\n### GitHub Copilot\n\nCreate file at `.github/instructions/<standard-slug>.md`:\n\n```md\n---\napplyTo: '**/*.ts'\n---\n## Standard: Typescript code standards\n\nAdopt TypeScript code standards by prefixing interfaces with \"I\" and abstract classes with \"Abstract\" while choosing \"Type\" for plain objects and \"Interface\" for implementations to enhance clarity and maintainability when writing .ts files. :\n* Prefix abstract classes with Abstract\n* Prefix interfaces with I\n* Use Type for plain objects, Interface when implmentation is required\n```\n\n## Skill Creation\n\nFor skill creation, follow the complete process in [packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md](packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md).\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6300,"cache_read_input_tokens":31495,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":6300},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYDYLqQ64htRQxfWe4jcM","type":"assistant","uuid":"73a30f23-c717-40c6-8c1a-c990340e9b06","timestamp":"2026-02-17T11:12:55.715Z"}

Defines constraints and conventions the agent must follow at all times.\n\n**Skill** — A folder with instructions, scripts, and resources loaded on-demand via progressive disclosure. Provides procedural knowledge activated when a task matches its description.\n\n### Decision Criteria\n\nAsk these four questions to decide whether a remediation should produce a standard or a skill:\n\n1. **Must the agent always know this?** If yes → standard. If it is only relevant during a specific task → skill.\n2. **Is it a constraint or a capability?** Constraints and guardrails → standard. Capabilities and workflows → skill.\n3. **Does it need bundled resources?** If it requires scripts, templates, or assets → skill. If a single file of rules suffices → standard.\n4. **Is it short and declarative?** Bullet-point rules → standard. Procedural paragraphs with sequenced steps → skill.\n\n### Boundary Rule\n\nExtract **rules** into a standard and **procedures** into a skill. A single remediation topic can produce both. When in doubt, prefer a standard.\n\n## Standard Creation\n\n### Generic Rules\n\n- Standards must contain a one sentence-summary describing the purpose of the rules, their intent, their rationale, as a short introduction.\n- Rules must be a list of bullet-points rules, starting with a verb.\n- Use scoped glob patterns when relevant based on the suggestions.\n\n### Claude Code\n\nCreate file at `.claude/rules/<standard-slug>.md`:\n\n```md\n---\nname: Domain Events\nalwaysApply: true\ndescription: Use when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners.\n---\n\n## Standard: Domain Events\n\nUse when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners. :\n\n- Define event classes in `packages/types/src/{domain}/events/` with an `index.ts` barrel file\n- Define payload as a separate `{EventName}Payload` interface\n- Extend `PackmindListener<TAdapter>` and implement `registerHandlers()` to subscribe to events\n- Extend `UserEvent` for user-triggered actions, `SystemEvent` for background/automated processes\n- Include `userId` and `organizationId` in UserEvent payloads; include `organizationId` in SystemEvent payloads when applicable\n- Suffix event class names with `Event` (e.g., `StandardUpdatedEvent`)\n- Use `eventEmitterService.emit(new MyEvent(payload))` to emit events\n- Use `static override readonly eventName` with `domain.entity.action` pattern\n- Use `this.subscribe(EventClass, this.handlerMethod)` to register handlers\n- Use arrow functions for handlers to preserve `this` binding\n```\n\n### AGENTS.md\n\nAppend a section specific to the coding standards and guidelines in AGENTS.md, at the location where it is most relevant:\n\n```md\n## Standard: Testing good practices\n\nStandardize unit test structure and naming in TypeScript/TSX test files using verb-first descriptions, Arrange-Act-Assert flow without comments, nested describe('when...') context blocks, and single-expect test cases to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging. :\n* Follow  'Arrange, Act, Assert' pattern\n* Move 'when' contextual clauses from `it()` into nested `describe('when...')` blocks\n* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels\n* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should'\n* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach\n```\n\n### GitHub Copilot\n\nCreate file at `.github/instructions/<standard-slug>.md`:\n\n```md\n---\napplyTo: '**/*.ts'\n---\n## Standard: Typescript code standards\n\nAdopt TypeScript code standards by prefixing interfaces with \"I\" and abstract classes with \"Abstract\" while choosing \"Type\" for plain objects and \"Interface\" for implementations to enhance clarity and maintainability when writing .ts files. :\n* Prefix abstract classes with Abstract\n* Prefix interfaces with I\n* Use Type for plain objects, Interface when implmentation is required\n```\n\n## Skill Creation\n\nFor skill creation, follow the complete process in [packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md](packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md).\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"73a30f23-c717-40c6-8c1a-c990340e9b06"}

Keep SKILL.md lean; move detailed schemas, API docs, and domain knowledge here.\n- **Assets** — Files used in output (templates, images, boilerplate) that Claude uses without loading into context.\n\n## Progressive Disclosure\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** — Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** — When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** — As needed by Claude (unlimited; scripts can execute without reading into context)\n\n## Metadata Quality\n\nThe `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore running any skill scripts, verify required tools:\n\n1. Check Python 3: `python3 --version` — install if missing (`brew install python3` / `sudo apt-get install python3`)\n2. Check Packmind CLI: `packmind-cli --version` — install if missing: `npm install -g packmind-cli`\n\n## Step 1: Understand Usage\n\nUnderstand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from direct user examples or generated examples validated with user feedback. Ask targeted questions about functionality, usage patterns, and triggers.\n\nConclude when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n## Step 2: Plan Resources\n\nAnalyze each concrete example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nCreate a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n## Step 3: Initialize\n\nSkip this step if the skill already exists and only iteration or packaging is needed.\n\nVerify that python3 and packmind-cli are available (see Prerequisites). Then run:\n\n```bash\npython3 scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script creates the skill directory with a SKILL.md template (proper frontmatter + TODO placeholders) and example `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` directories. Customize or remove generated files as needed.\n\n## Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nThe skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on information that would be beneficial and non-obvious. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute tasks more effectively.\n\n### Start with Resources\n\nImplement the reusable resources identified in Step 2: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. This may require user input (e.g., brand assets, documentation, templates). Delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill.\n\n### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\").\n\nAnswer these questions in SKILL.md:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n2. When should the skill be used?\n3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents must be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n## Step 5: Validate\n\nVerify that python3 is available (see Prerequisites). Then run:\n\n```bash\npython3 scripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nThe validation script checks YAML frontmatter format and required fields, naming conventions, directory structure, and description quality. Fix any reported errors and re-validate.\n\n## Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill on real tasks, notice struggles or inefficiencies. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated. Implement changes and test again.\n\n## Step 7: Distribute\n\nAfter successful validation, always run the distribution command. Do not skip this step.\n\nVerify that packmind-cli is available (see Prerequisites). Then run:\n\n```bash\npackmind-cli skills add <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nThis registers the skill with Packmind, making it available for deployment to target repositories and AI coding agents.\n\n## Step 8: Package Assignment\n\nAfter successful distribution, check if the skill fits an existing package:\n\n1. Run `packmind-cli install --list` to get available packages\n2. If no packages exist, skip silently and end the workflow\n3. Analyze the skill's name and description against each package's name and description\n4. If a package is a clear semantic fit (the skill's domain/technology aligns with the package's purpose):\n   - Present to user: \"This skill seems to fit the `<package-slug>` package.\"\n   - Offer: Add to suggested package / Choose a different package / Skip\n5. If no clear fit, skip silently (do not mention packages)\n6. If user chooses to add:\n   - Run: `packmind-cli packages add --to <package-slug> --skill <skill-slug>`\n   - Ask: \"Would you like me to run `packmind-cli install` to sync the changes?\"\n   - If yes, run: `packmind-cli install`\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6300,"cache_read_input_tokens":31495,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":6300},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYDYLqQ64htRQxfWe4jcM","type":"assistant","uuid":"68ac393a-400d-419b-be0a-e0d8429efb7d","timestamp":"2026-02-17T11:13:15.690Z"}

Provides procedural knowledge activated when a task matches its description.\n\n### Decision Criteria\n\nAsk these four questions to decide whether a remediation should produce a standard or a skill:\n\n1. **Must the agent always know this?** If yes → standard. If it is only relevant during a specific task → skill.\n2. **Is it a constraint or a capability?** Constraints and guardrails → standard. Capabilities and workflows → skill.\n3. **Does it need bundled resources?** If it requires scripts, templates, or assets → skill. If a single file of rules suffices → standard.\n4. **Is it short and declarative?** Bullet-point rules → standard. Procedural paragraphs with sequenced steps → skill.\n\n### Boundary Rule\n\nExtract **rules** into a standard and **procedures** into a skill. A single remediation topic can produce both. When in doubt, prefer a standard.\n\n## Standard Creation\n\n### Generic Rules\n\n- Standards must contain a one sentence-summary describing the purpose of the rules, their intent, their rationale, as a short introduction.\n- Rules must be a list of bullet-points rules, starting with a verb.\n- Use scoped glob patterns when relevant based on the suggestions.\n\n### Claude Code\n\nCreate file at `.claude/rules/<standard-slug>.md`:\n\n```md\n---\nname: Domain Events\nalwaysApply: true\ndescription: Use when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners.\n---\n\n## Standard: Domain Events\n\nUse when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners. :\n\n- Define event classes in `packages/types/src/{domain}/events/` with an `index.ts` barrel file\n- Define payload as a separate `{EventName}Payload` interface\n- Extend `PackmindListener<TAdapter>` and implement `registerHandlers()` to subscribe to events\n- Extend `UserEvent` for user-triggered actions, `SystemEvent` for background/automated processes\n- Include `userId` and `organizationId` in UserEvent payloads; include `organizationId` in SystemEvent payloads when applicable\n- Suffix event class names with `Event` (e.g., `StandardUpdatedEvent`)\n- Use `eventEmitterService.emit(new MyEvent(payload))` to emit events\n- Use `static override readonly eventName` with `domain.entity.action` pattern\n- Use `this.subscribe(EventClass, this.handlerMethod)` to register handlers\n- Use arrow functions for handlers to preserve `this` binding\n```\n\n### AGENTS.md\n\nAppend a section specific to the coding standards and guidelines in AGENTS.md, at the location where it is most relevant:\n\n```md\n## Standard: Testing good practices\n\nStandardize unit test structure and naming in TypeScript/TSX test files using verb-first descriptions, Arrange-Act-Assert flow without comments, nested describe('when...') context blocks, and single-expect test cases to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging. :\n* Follow  'Arrange, Act, Assert' pattern\n* Move 'when' contextual clauses from `it()` into nested `describe('when...')` blocks\n* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels\n* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should'\n* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach\n```\n\n### GitHub Copilot\n\nCreate file at `.github/instructions/<standard-slug>.md`:\n\n```md\n---\napplyTo: '**/*.ts'\n---\n## Standard: Typescript code standards\n\nAdopt TypeScript code standards by prefixing interfaces with \"I\" and abstract classes with \"Abstract\" while choosing \"Type\" for plain objects and \"Interface\" for implementations to enhance clarity and maintainability when writing .ts files. :\n* Prefix abstract classes with Abstract\n* Prefix interfaces with I\n* Use Type for plain objects, Interface when implmentation is required\n```\n\n## Skill Creation\n\nFor skill creation, follow the complete process in [packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md](packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md).\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":89,"oldLines":4,"newStart":89,"newLines":6,"lines":[" "," ## Skill Creation"," ","+For AGENTS.md targets, skills are placed in the `.agent/skills/` directory.","+"," For skill creation, follow the complete process in [packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md](packmind-remediation-skill-creation.md)."]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"79be96ce-e9f6-44fa-8622-23deeda723ba"}
