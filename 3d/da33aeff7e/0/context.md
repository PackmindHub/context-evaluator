### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Create `packmind-remediation-prompt.md`

## Context

The `skills/context-remediation/` directory contains ~390 lines across 3 source files (SKILL.md, standard-creation.md, packmind-create-skill/SKILL.md) plus 2 Python scripts. A remediation module needs a condensed, actionable prompt that consolidates all this knowledge. Currently the content is spread across files designed for human reading and progressive disclosure — not optimized for a single AI modul...

### Prompt 2

Mention also that that for AGENTS.md target, the skills should be in ".agent/skills" directory
