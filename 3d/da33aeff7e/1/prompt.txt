Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Update SKILL.md with skills vs standards guidance

## Context

The `skills/context-remediation/SKILL.md` file has an empty "When to create skills and standards" section. During remediations, the AI agent needs clear decision criteria to determine whether a gap should be remediated as a **skill** (on-demand procedural knowledge) or a **standard** (always-loaded rules). The user provided verbal guidance, two reference URLs, and the requirement that instructions be agent-agnostic.

## Research findings

- **Skills** (from [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/home)): folders of instructions + scripts + resources, loaded on-demand via progressive disclosure when a task matches. For workflows, procedures, domain expertise.
- **Standards** (from [Claude Code rules docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#modular-rules-with-claude%2Frules%2F)): single files of short declarative rules, always loaded (unconditionally or path-scoped). For conventions, constraints, guardrails.

## Changes

**Single file to edit**: `skills/context-remediation/SKILL.md`

Replace the empty `# When to create skills and standards` section (lines 8-9) with content containing:

### 1. "What is a standard" subsection
- Short declarative rules always loaded into agent context
- Use for: coding conventions, naming patterns, architectural constraints, guardrails
- Reference link to Claude Code rules doc as an example of agent-specific implementation

### 2. "What is a skill" subsection
- Folder of instructions/scripts/resources loaded on-demand when task matches
- Progressive disclosure: only description at startup, full content when activated
- Use for: multi-step workflows, procedural knowledge, domain expertise, tool integrations
- Reference link to agentskills.io

### 3. "Decision criteria" subsection — 4 yes/no questions
1. **Must the agent always know this?** → always = standard, task-specific = skill
2. **Is it a constraint or a capability?** → constraint = standard, capability/workflow = skill
3. **Does it need bundled resources?** → scripts/templates/assets = skill, single file = standard
4. **Is it short and declarative?** → bullet-point rules = standard, procedural paragraphs = skill

### 4. "When the boundary is unclear" subsection
- Heuristic: extract **rules** into a standard, extract **procedures** into a skill
- Worked example: "testing" remediation → standard for "use AAA pattern" + skill for full test infrastructure setup workflow
- Default: when in doubt, prefer a standard (simpler, always available)

### Design principles applied
- **Agent-agnostic language**: no "Claude Code rule" or "Copilot instruction" — only "standard" and "skill"
- **Reference links provided but not central**: URLs included as "Reference:" notes
- **Concise**: ~350 words total for the new section
- **Tone**: imperative/instructional, matching existing files

## Verification

1. `bun run test` — ensure no regressions
2. `bun run lint` — ensure formatting passes
3. Manual review: read the updated SKILL.md to confirm it flows naturally with existing sections
