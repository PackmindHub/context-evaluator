    "intent": "Add per-agent Skills rows and real logos for GitHub Copilot and Cursor in the Context tab, mirroring how Claude Code already surfaces skills.",
    "outcome": "Successfully implemented all changes in ContextTab.tsx: skills split by path prefix, new Skills rows for Copilot/Cursor, CopilotLogo/CursorLogo components, separate SkillsBrowserModal instances, and updated section visibility. Tests and lint passed; committed to main.",

        "Skills are stored flat in a single array and distinguished by their `path` field (set by `getRelativePath()`), using prefixes: `.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`",
        "The project uses Biome for linting; ternary expressions must be kept on a single line to pass lint checks",
        "Test and lint commands are `bun run test` and `bun run lint`; `bun run lint:fix` auto-fixes some issues",

      "workflow": [
        "When edits accumulate stale variable references (e.g., removed `skillsCount`), writing the complete corrected file with Write tool is cleaner than chaining multiple Edit operations",
        "Biome lint errors on ternary formatting were caught post-edit and fixed with `bun run lint:fix` before final lint verification",
        "The `rtk` prefix appears to be a shell alias/wrapper used in this repo for running commands"

    },
    "friction": [
      "Multiple Read passes were needed mid-implementation to track the current state of the file after sequential edits",
      "Biome lint failed after initial implementation due to multi-line ternary expressions, requiring a follow-up fix pass",
      "Stale variable reference (`skillsCount`) left over from incremental edits required rewriting the full file rather than targeted patches"

      "The SVG logos for CopilotLogo and CursorLogo are described as approximate representations (robot-face, block-letter mark) rather than the exact official brand SVG paths — may want to replace with pixel-accurate official logos",
      "No test coverage was added for the new Copilot/Cursor skills rows or modal states since this was UI-only; visual verification was deferred to manual browser testing"
