    "outcome": "Replaced the corrupted cursor-logo.svg (which contained a literal '404: Not Found' string) with the real Cursor SVG from Simple Icons, updated the CursorLogo component path in AgentLogos.tsx, and successfully committed after removing a leftover temp clone directory that was blocking the pre-commit hook.",

        "tmp/clones/ is used for evaluation runs and can accumulate leftover directories (e.g., agents-eval-DtKspd) whose test files get picked up by bun, polluting the test run.",
