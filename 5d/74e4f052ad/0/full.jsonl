Add new sections at the most relevant location.\\n\\n## Instructions\\n1. Read the target files from disk before making changes\\n2. Use your own judgment to assess each issue: these were produced by an automated evaluator and some may be false positives or irrelevant given the actual file content. Skip any issue that is not a real problem after reading the file\\n3. **Note:** The **Fix** text for each issue was generated without knowledge of standards or skills — it may describe inline edits even when a skill or standard would be more appropriate. Use the output type decision criteria and the evaluator category to override the suggested approach when warranted.\\n4. For each remaining issue, decide the output type (standard, skill, or generic update) using the decision criteria above\\n5. When multiple issues target the same file and related topics, consolidate them into well-organized sections rather than creating many small isolated additions\\n6. Fix each remaining issue, highest severity first\\n7. Preserve all correct existing content\\n8. Keep changes minimal — only fix what's genuinely flagged\\n9. Do not add commentary, headers, or sections beyond what's needed\\n10. After making all changes, output a JSON summary:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"actions\\\": [\\n    { \\\"issueIndex\\\": 1, \\\"status\\\": \\\"fixed\\\", \\\"file\\\": \\\"AGENTS.md\\\", \\\"summary\\\": \\\"Replaced vague setup instructions with exact commands\\\", \\\"outputType\\\": \\\"generic\\\" },\\n    { \\\"issueIndex\\\": 2, \\\"status\\\": \\\"added\\\", \\\"file\\\": \\\".claude/rules/git-conventions.md\\\", \\\"summary\\\": \\\"Created git conventions standard\\\", \\\"outputType\\\": \\\"standard\\\" },\\n    { \\\"issueIndex\\\": 3, \\\"status\\\": \\\"skipped\\\", \\\"summary\\\": \\\"Not a real issue after reading the file\\\" }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\nUse issue numbers from above. Status: \\\"fixed\\\", \\\"added\\\", or \\\"skipped\\\". Use \\\"fixed\\\" for inline edits and \\\"added\\\" for new files. Include `outputType` (\\\"standard\\\", \\\"skill\\\", or \\\"generic\\\") for non-skipped actions.

Also adds a consolidation hint.\n\n2. **Instructions section (around line 488):** Added a new step 3 warning that Fix suggestions from evaluators were generated without knowledge of skills/standards and may describe inline edits even when a skill or standard is more appropriate.

It's rendered conditionally in `/frontend/src/App.tsx` when evaluation data exists.\n\n**Location**: `/Users/cedricteyton/Code/agents-md-evaluator/frontend/src/components/Summary.tsx` (lines 113-901)\n\n### 2. **Repository URL Display Location**\n\nThe git/repository URL is displayed prominently in the **Summary component's header section** (lines 116-314):\n\n**Display Implementation** (Summary.tsx, lines 120-159):\n```typescript\n{repositoryUrl && (\n  <div className=\"flex items-center gap-2 mb-3\">\n    <a\n      href={repositoryUrl}\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n      className=\"flex items-center gap-2 hover:opacity-80 transition-opacity group\"\n    >\n      {/* GitHub icon + extracted repo name + external link icon */}\n      <div className=\"w-8 h-8 bg-slate-700/60 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center...\">\n        {/* GitHub icon SVG */}\n      </div>\n      <span className=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-slate-100 group-hover:underline\">\n        {extractRepoName(repositoryUrl)}  {/* Extracts name from URL */}\n      </span>\n      {/* External link arrow icon */}\n    </a>\n  </div>\n)}\n```\n\n**Key Features**:\n- Shows the **full clickable link** to the repository\n- Displays the **extracted repository name** (e.g., \"context-evaluator\" from \"https://github.com/PackmindHub/context-evaluator\")\n- Includes GitHub icon and external link indicator\n- Hover effect shows underline\n- Opens in new tab when clicked\n\n### 3. **Header/Summary Section Structure**\n\nThe Summary component has a **prominent header card** (lines 115-314) that includes:\n\n1. **Repository Display** (lines 120-159)\n   - Clickable GitHub link with repo name\n   - Only displays if `repositoryUrl` prop exists\n\n2. **Metadata Badges** (lines 160-241)\n   - Evaluation timestamp\n   - AI provider used (e.g., \"claude\")\n   - Evaluation mode (unified/independent)\n\n3. **Action Buttons** (lines 243-312)\n   - Re-run evaluation button\n   - Delete button (non-cloud mode only)\n\n4. **Share Report Card** (lines 317-388)\n   - Shows shareable evaluation URL\n   - Copy-to-clipboard button\n   - Only displays if `evaluationId` exists\n\n### 4. **Data Flow - Where Repository URL Comes From**\n\n**Data Source Chain**:\n\n1. **App.tsx** (top-level):\n   - Stores `currentRepositoryUrl` in state (line 134-136)\n   - Updates from `handleUrlSubmit()` (line 614: `setCurrentRepositoryUrl(url)`)\n   - Passes to Summary component (line 1880: `repositoryUrl={currentRepositoryUrl}`)\n\n2. **Summary Component** (lines 29-31, 60):\n   ```typescript\n   interface SummaryProps {\n     repositoryUrl?: string | null;\n     // ... other props\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Loading from History**:\n   - When loading completed evaluations, URL is retrieved from database (App.tsx, lines 857, 768, 803)\n   - History records include `repositoryUrl` field\n\n4. **ProgressPanel** (during evaluation):\n   - Shows repository URL while evaluation is running (visible before Summary appears)\n\n### 5. **Available Data in Summary Component**\n\nThe Summary component receives:\n- **`repositoryUrl`**: The git repository URL (e.g., \"https://github.com/user/repo\")\n- **`metadata`**: Complete evaluation metadata including:\n  - `generatedAt`: Timestamp of evaluation\n  - `agent`: AI provider name\n  - `evaluationMode`: \"unified\" or \"independent\"\n  - `projectContext`: Detected languages, frameworks, architecture, patterns\n  - `totalFiles`: Number of files evaluated\n  - `filesEvaluated`: Array of file paths\n  - Cost and duration data\n  - Curation metrics\n\n- **`evaluationId`**: For sharing and linking\n- **`curation`**: Curated issues breakdown (errors/suggestions)\n- **`evaluationLogs`**: Activity log from evaluation process\n\n### 6. **Component Hierarchy**\n\n```\nApp.tsx (main entry)\n├── AppHeader (sticky navigation)\n├── SelectionSummaryBar\n├── Tabs\n│   ├── TabPanel id=\"summary\"\n│   │   └── Summary.tsx  ← RENDERS THE REPORT\n│   ├── TabPanel id=\"context\"\n│   │   └── ContextTab\n│   ├── TabPanel id=\"errors\"\n│   ├── TabPanel id=\"suggestions\"\n│   └── ... other tabs\n├── ProgressPanel (during evaluation)\n└── Footer\n```\n\n### 7. **Key Functions Used**\n\n- **`extractRepoName()`** (`frontend/src/lib/formatters.ts`):\n  -

What Does AppHeader Show?\n\nThe `AppHeader` component (in `/Users/cedricteyton/Code/agents-md-evaluator/frontend/src/components/AppHeader.tsx`) displays:\n\n- **Logo** - The animated robot/document icon with \"context-evaluator\" branding and subtitle \"AI agent documentation quality analyzer\"\n- **Navigation Links** - Home, Latest, Issues, Evaluators, Stats, How it works?, Assessment (feature-flagged), and GitHub link\n- **Active Page Indicator** - Highlights the current page with `bg-slate-700` background\n- **History Count Badge** - Shows number of recent evaluations on the \"Latest\" tab\n\n**Important**: The AppHeader does **NOT** currently display the repository URL.\n\n---\n\n### 2. What Props Does AppHeader Receive?\n\nFrom `/Users/cedricteyton/Code/agents-md-evaluator/frontend/src/App.tsx` (line 1841-1845):\n\n```typescript\n<AppHeader\n  currentPage=\"home\"           // Always \"home\" (not context-aware to evaluation)\n  onLogoClick={handleClear}    // Clears evaluation on logo click\n  historyCount={historyApi.history.length}  // Count of past evaluations\n/>\n```\n\n**Props interface** (AppHeader.tsx lines 3-16):\n- `onLogoClick?`: Custom click handler\n- `logoNavigatesHome?`: Default true\n- `currentPage?`: Page identifier (hardcoded \"home\" in App.tsx)\n- `historyCount?`: Number of recent evaluations\n- `showAssessment?`: Override feature flag for Assessment link\n\n**Critical limitation**: `AppHeader` does **not** receive `repositoryUrl` or any evaluation-specific data.

Currently it's in the Summary tab body and scrolls away. Options:\n\n1. **Add to AppHeader** - Pass `repositoryUrl` to AppHeader and show it there. This is the cleanest approach since AppHeader is sticky.\n\n2. **Create a Repository Info Bar** - Like SelectionSummaryBar, create a fixed bar below the AppHeader that shows the URL. This follows an existing pattern.\n\n3. **Show in the \"tabs\" header area** - Maybe add it to the tab bar or just below it.\n   \nI'm leaning toward adding it directly to the sticky AppHeader since it's already positioned at the top and won't require a new component.

The AppHeader is `sticky top-0 z-50` and has a clean layout. The navigation links are on the right side in a flex row.\n\nFor making the git URL \"always visible\", I think the best approach is to add a second row to the AppHeader (below the current nav row) that shows the URL when one is active. This way it remains sticky and is always visible at the top.\n\nAlternatively, I could add the URL inline in the header between the logo and the nav links.\n\nLooking at the layout: it's a `flex items-center justify-between` div with logo on left and nav on right. \n\nI'm weighing three options: putting the URL in the center of the existing header row when active, adding a second row below the current navigation, or creating a separate fixed banner like the SelectionSummaryBar pattern. The center approach seems simplest and most compact, requiring just the repo name as a link between the logo and nav.\n\nFor implementation, I'd add a `repositoryUrl` prop to AppHeader, extract the repo name when it's set, and display it as a centered clickable link. This keeps the URL always visible in the sticky header without extra space or modifying the existing structure. I should verify how `extractRepoName` is currently exposed so AppHeader can import and use it.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4424,"cache_read_input_tokens":51295,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":4424},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYGEQxhfJ4WzMmDhVoRpE","type":"assistant","uuid":"9b7cd2a9-4229-4950-9f1f-6ebd9a061852","timestamp":"2026-02-18T21:19:14.680Z"}

Use the output type decision criteria and the evaluator category to override the suggested approach when warranted.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- **`src/shared/remediation/prompt-generator.ts`**\n  - `errorDefaultGuidance` string (lines 236–239): replace content\n  - `buildErrorFixPrompt()` Instructions section (around line 480): add warning note about Fix suggestions\n\n## Expected Outcome\n\nWith these changes, the remediation prompt for the example would guide the AI to:\n- Issues #1, #4, #5, #10, #11, #12, #21 (`outdated-documentation`) → **generic update**\n- Issues #8, #15, #16 (`git-workflow`) → **skill** (consolidated into one git-workflow skill, overriding their inline-edit Fix suggestions)\n- Issues #3, #19, #20 (`security`) → **standard** or **generic**\n- Issues #6 (`code-style`, ESLint→Biome) → **standard**\n- Issues #7, #13, #14 (`structure-formatting`) → **generic update**\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `bun run test` — confirm no regressions\n2. `bun run typecheck` — no type errors\n3. Manually inspect the generated prompt: call `POST /api/remediation/generate-prompts` with git-workflow issues and verify (a) no \"default to generic\" bias, (b) warning about Fix suggestions is present\n"},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"723539a3-750b-46dd-b3d6-b884ea97fd6d"}

The user wants the URL to remain visible at all times while navigating the report. Since `AppHeader` is already `sticky top-0 z-50`, adding the URL there is the minimal and correct solution.\n\n## Approach\n\nAdd a centered repo name/link to the AppHeader's existing single row when an evaluation is active. Between the logo (left) and nav links (right), show the extracted repository name as a small GitHub-icon + clickable link. This leverages the `justify-between` flex layout: logo on left, repo in center, nav on right.\n\n- No new component, no new fixed bar, no z-index juggling\n- Disappears when no evaluation is active (keeps the header clean on the home/empty state)\n- For GitHub URLs: show extracted repo name (e.g. `user/repo`)\n- For local paths: show the path as-is (no GitHub icon in that case)\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n### 1. `frontend/src/components/AppHeader.tsx`\n- Add `repositoryUrl?: string | null` to `AppHeaderProps`\n- Import `extractRepoName` from `../lib/formatters`\n- In the flex row (between logo button and nav links div), add a centered element:\n  ```tsx\n  {repositoryUrl && (\n    <a\n      href={repositoryUrl.startsWith(\"http\") ? repositoryUrl : undefined}\n      target={repositoryUrl.startsWith(\"http\") ? \"_blank\" : undefined}\n      rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n      className=\"flex items-center gap-1.5 text-slate-300 hover:text-slate-100 transition-colors text-sm\"\n    >\n      {/* GitHub icon (only for http URLs) */}\n      <span className=\"font-medium\">{extractRepoName(repositoryUrl)}</span>\n      {/* external link icon for http URLs */}\n    </a>\n  )}\n  ```\n- Wrap in an `absolute left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2` container so it stays truly centered regardless of logo/nav widths\n\n### 2. `frontend/src/App.tsx`\n- Pass `currentRepositoryUrl` to `<AppHeader>` (line ~1841):\n  ```tsx\n  <AppHeader\n    currentPage=\"home\"\n    onLogoClick={handleClear}\n    historyCount={historyApi.history.length}\n    repositoryUrl={currentRepositoryUrl}   // ← add this\n  />\n  ```\n\n## Key References\n\n- `extractRepoName` — `frontend/src/lib/formatters.ts` (already used in Summary.tsx)\n- `currentRepositoryUrl` — App.tsx state, already passed to Summary and RemediateTab\n- AppHeader layout — `frontend/src/components/AppHeader.tsx` line 43: `flex items-center justify-between`\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `bun run test` — no regressions\n2. `bun run typecheck` — no type errors\n3.
