Implement the following plan:

# Fix Output Type Bias in Remediation Prompt Generator

## Context

The remediation prompt generator has two compounding problems that both bias the AI executor toward "generic update" (inline edits) over creating skills or standards:

**Problem 1 — `errorDefaultGuidance` bias:** The guidance text added for errors explicitly says "default to generic update," overriding the three-question decision criteria that would correctly classify `git-workflow` issues as skills.

**Problem 2 — Evaluator Fix suggestions are unaware of skills/standards:** The 19 evaluators that produce issues have no knowledge of the standard/skill/generic classification. Their **Fix** field describes inline edits (e.g., "Add this section to AGENTS.md: ..."), nudging the AI executor to treat everything as a generic update even when a skill would be more appropriate. The prompt never warns the executor about this.

**Concrete example:** Issue #15 (`git-workflow` — commit message format) has a Fix that says "Specify a commit message format explicitly, e.g.: `### Commit Message Format`..." — this reads as "add a section to AGENTS.md," so the executor does just that, ignoring that a git-workflow skill would be better.

## Problem Location

`src/shared/remediation/prompt-generator.ts`

- **Lines 236–239** — `errorDefaultGuidance` variable (bias toward generic)
- **Lines 478–496** — `## Instructions` section in `buildErrorFixPrompt()` (no warning about evaluator Fix suggestions)

The issue block header already shows `evaluatorName: category` (e.g., `git-workflow: Workflow Integration`) at line 151, so the evaluator-type signal is already visible.

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: Replace `errorDefaultGuidance` with fix-nature-based guidance

```typescript
const errorDefaultGuidance =
    context === "error"
        ? `\n\n**Choosing the right type for error fixes:**
- Factual corrections (wrong paths, outdated names, incorrect references) → **generic update**
- New procedural workflows (commit steps, CI/CD procedures, deployment flows) → **skill**
- New constraints or guardrails (security rules, coding conventions) → **standard**

Use the evaluator category in each issue header as a signal:
- \`outdated-documentation\`, \`structure-formatting\`, \`completeness\` → usually **generic update**
- \`git-workflow\`, \`testing\`, \`deployment\` → usually **skill** (procedural)
- \`security\`, \`code-style\` → usually **standard** (constraints) or **generic**

When multiple issues share the same evaluator category and topic, consolidate them into a single output rather than creating many small separate additions.`
        : "";
```

### Change 2: Add a warning about evaluator Fix suggestions in the Instructions section

In `buildErrorFixPrompt()`, add an explicit note (either in the `## Role` section or as a new instruction step) warning that Fix suggestions are unaware of skills/standards:

Add to the Instructions list (before step 3 "For each remaining issue, decide the output type"):

> **Note:** The **Fix** text for each issue was generated without knowledge of standards or skills — it may describe inline edits even when a skill or standard would be more appropriate. Use the output type decision criteria and the evaluator category to override the suggested approach when warranted.

## Files to Modify

- **`src/shared/remediation/prompt-generator.ts`**
  - `errorDefaultGuidance` string (lines 236–239): replace content
  - `buildErrorFixPrompt()` Instructions section (around line 480): add warning note about Fix suggestions

## Expected Outcome

With these changes, the remediation prompt for the example would guide the AI to:
- Issues #1, #4, #5, #10, #11, #12, #21 (`outdated-documentation`) → **generic update**
- Issues #8, #15, #16 (`git-workflow`) → **skill** (consolidated into one git-workflow skill, overriding their inline-edit Fix suggestions)
- Issues #3, #19, #20 (`security`) → **standard** or **generic**
- Issues #6 (`code-style`, ESLint→Biome) → **standard**
- Issues #7, #13, #14 (`structure-formatting`) → **generic update**

## Verification

1. `bun run test` — confirm no regressions
2. `bun run typecheck` — no type errors
3. Manually inspect the generated prompt: call `POST /api/remediation/generate-prompts` with git-workflow issues and verify (a) no "default to generic" bias, (b) warning about Fix suggestions is present
