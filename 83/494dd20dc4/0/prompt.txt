Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Add Remediate Feature Documentation to README.md

## Context

The codebase has a fully-implemented "Remediate" feature (web UI only) that lets users automatically fix documentation issues found during evaluation. It's not mentioned anywhere in the README. This plan adds a mention in the intro and a dedicated section.

## Changes

**File:** `README.md`

### 1. Update intro paragraph (line 5)

**Current:**
```
This tool evaluates your AI agent instruction files using 17 specialized evaluators to identify issues and improvement opportunities. It helps ensure your documentation provides clear, actionable guidance for AI coding assistants.
```

**New:**
```
This tool evaluates your AI agent instruction files using 17 specialized evaluators to identify issues and improvement opportunities, and can automatically remediate them using AI. It helps ensure your documentation provides clear, actionable guidance for AI coding assistants.
```

### 2. Insert new `## Remediation` section after "Understanding Results" (after line 97, before "Evaluators")

```markdown

## Remediation

After reviewing evaluation results, you can automatically fix issues using AI-powered remediation (web UI only).

### How it works

1. **Select issues** — Use the + button on issue cards to add them to your selection basket
2. **Configure** — Choose your target file type (AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md) and AI provider
3. **Execute** — Click "Execute Remediation" to let the AI agent fix errors and add missing content
4. **Review** — Inspect the generated diffs per file, then download the patch

Errors are fixed first (sorted by severity), then suggestions are added on top. Issues are batched automatically to stay within token limits.

### Output

- Per-file diffs with additions/deletions
- Action summary showing what was fixed, added, or skipped
- Downloadable `.patch` file
- Cost and token usage breakdown

### Alternative: Generate Prompts

If you prefer manual control, click "Generate Prompts" to get copy-paste-ready prompts for your own CLI agent.
```

## Verification

- Read the updated README to confirm formatting and placement
- Run `bun run test` and `bun run lint` to ensure no issues

now we should highlight the "Remediate" feature in addition to existing features, and I think that in the UI, we must update 1) the welcome page to mention that 2) the "How it works" page to highlight this. Suggest ways to improve this.
