Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Highlight Remediation Feature in Welcome Page & How It Works Page

## Context

The Remediate feature is fully implemented in the web UI but invisible to new users. The welcome page (EmptyState) only says "Analyze your AI agent context" and the How It Works page shows a 4-step flow ending at "Actionable Results" — neither mentions that users can automatically fix the issues found. This plan adds remediation visibility to both pages.
