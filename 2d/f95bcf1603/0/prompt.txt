Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Redesign Action Summary — Group by Target File

## Context

The current Action Summary in `RemediationHistoryCard` renders all actions as a flat list, mixing different target files and strategies together. This makes it hard to understand what changed where. The redesign groups actions by their target file (like a directory tree), removes the strategy badge, and adds a clear "Skipped" section at the bottom.

## User Requirements (confirmed via Q&A)

- **Group by target file** (alphabetical order, like directory tree)
- **Group header**: file path only — no strategy (outputType) displayed anywhere
- **No file** → "General changes" group
- **Multi-file actions** ("AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md") → single combined group header, sorted as-is
- **Skipped**: flat "Skipped (N)" section at the bottom, just action text with dash
- **Strategy badge removed** from individual action rows entirely

## File to Modify

**Only one file changes:**
- `frontend/src/components/RemediationHistoryCard.tsx` — the `CompactActionSummary` function (lines 344–392)

## Implementation Design

### Grouping Logic

```ts
// 1. Separate addressed vs skipped
const addressedActions = allActions.filter(a => a.status !== "skipped");
const skippedActions = allActions.filter(a => a.status === "skipped");

// 2. Group addressed by file
const groups = Map<string, RemediationAction[]>
  // key = action.file ?? "General changes"
  // sorted alphabetically by key

// 3. Sort group keys alphabetically
const sortedKeys = [...groups.keys()].sort((a, b) => {
  // "General changes" always last
  if (a === "General changes") return 1;
  if (b === "General changes") return -1;
  return a.localeCompare(b);
});
```

### Visual Structure

```
Action Summary                     30 addressed, 5 skipped

 AGENTS.md
  ✓ Replaced collectors/ with connectors/...
  ✓ Added CI/CD Pipeline section with ci.yml...
  ✓ Added merge strategy section...

 AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md
  ✓ Replaced ESLint references with Biome throughout both files
  ✓ Replaced providers/ with llm/ and updated descriptions

 CLAUDE.md
  ✓ Added Documentation Directories section...

 .claude/rules/security.md
  ✓ Created always-apply security standard...

 General changes
  ✓ ...

Skipped (5)
  — Both files serve valid purposes; merging requires human decision
  — AGENTS.md already uses GIT_TOKEN, not GITHUB_TOKEN
  — CLAUDE.md already references daily-update.yml correctly
```

### Key Changes to `CompactActionSummary`

1. **Remove** the `{action.outputType && ...}` badge block from each row
2. **Add** grouping logic at the top of the component
3. **Replace** the flat `allActions.map(...)` with:
   - Iterate `sortedKeys`, render a group header (file path, monospace, subtle style)
   - Under each header, render addressed actions for that group
   - After all groups, render "Skipped" section if `skippedActions.length > 0`
4. **Group header style**: small monospace label, slightly brighter than action text, with a thin left border or dot separator — consistent with existing slate color system

### No backend changes needed

All necessary data (`action.file`, `action.status`, `action.summary`) already exists in the frontend data model.

## Verification

1. `bun run test` — confirm no regressions
2. `bun run lint` — confirm Biome passes
3. Visual check in browser: open a remediation with mixed file targets and verify groups appear correctly sorted
4. Visual check: skipped items appear only in the bottom flat section
5. Verify strategy badge is gone from all rows
