Implement the following plan:

# Fix: Show issues alongside diff when expanded

## Context

In `UnifiedFileRow`, the expanded/collapsed states use a ternary that hides issues (action bullets) when the diff is shown. Users expect to see both the issues and the diff when expanded.

## Change

**File**: `frontend/src/components/RemediationHistoryCard.tsx` (lines 631-654)

Replace the ternary with:
1. Always render action bullets when they exist
2. Additionally render the diff when expanded

```tsx
{/* Row body */}
{entry.actions.length > 0 && (
  <div className="border-t border-slate-700/30 px-6 py-1.5 space-y-1">
    {entry.actions.map((action) => (
      <div key={`${action.issueIndex}-${action.status}`} className="flex items-start gap-2 text-xs">
        <span className="text-green-400 mt-0.5">✓</span>
        <span className="text-slate-400 flex-1">{action.summary}</span>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
)}
{expanded && (
  <div className="border-t border-slate-700/40 pt-2 pb-2 space-y-2">
    {entry.fileChanges.map((fc) => (
      <DiffViewer key={fc.path} diff={fc.diff} />
    ))}
  </div>
)}
```

## Verification

1. Run `bun run test`
2. Run `bun run dev` and trigger a remediation
3. Verify: collapsed state shows issues with checkmarks
4. Verify: expanded state shows issues AND the diff below them
