    "intent": "Fix the UnifiedFileRow component in RemediationHistoryCard.tsx so that action bullet issues are always visible alongside the diff when a file row is expanded, rather than being hidden by a ternary.",
    "outcome": "Replaced the ternary (lines 631-654) with two independent conditional blocks — actions always render when present, diff renders additionally when expanded. All 1318 tests passed, lint passed, and the change was committed.",
